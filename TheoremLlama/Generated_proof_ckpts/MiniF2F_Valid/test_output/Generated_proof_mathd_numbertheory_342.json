        "-- Calculate the remainder when 54 is divided by 6.\n\n-- First, express 54 as a multiple of 6 plus another value, r.\n-- Here, 54 is expressed as 9 times 6, leaving 0.\n\n-- Then, rewrite the remainder as a modular arithmetic expression,\n-- stating that 54 is congruent to 0 modulo 6.\n\n-- Finally, use the ZMod.int_cast_zmod_val lemma to convert the modular\n-- result back into a natural number. Since 0 is congruent to itself\n-- modulo any number, this conversion leaves us with the desired result:\n\n-- 0.\n--\n\n-- Let's break down the steps step-by-step for clarity:\n\n-- 1. `nlinarith`: The tactic performs a simple calculation involving\n--    natural numbers (`â„•`).\n\n-- 2. `(by decide; split; assumption)`:\n\n--     - `by decide`: Apply default tactics (e.g., `decide`) before\n--       attempting more specific approaches.\n\n--     - `split; assumption`: Split the goal into two parts: one for each\n--       side of the modular equation and assume the other side holds.\n\n-- 3. `ring`: Perform a series of algebraic manipulations using\n--    ring-theoretic properties.\n\n-- These steps demonstrate how we can break down the problem into smaller\n-- pieces, leveraging different tactics and lemmas to achieve the desired\n-- result.\n--\n-- The following code implements these steps:\n"
