        "-- What is the smallest positive integer N such that the value 7 + (30 × N) is not a prime number?\n\n-- Show that it is 6.\n\n-- Given a positive integer n, let's assume that 7 + (30 × n) is not a prime number.\n-- In other words, there exists a prime factor p such that 7 + (30 × n) = q * p, where q is another positive integer.\n\n-- Consider the expression 7 + (30 × n). Since it is not a prime number, it must have at least two distinct prime factors.\n\n-- Let's analyze the possible prime factors of 7 + (30 × n).\n\n-- First, note that 7 itself cannot be a prime factor since 7 + (30 × n) - 7 = (30 × n), which is always divisible by 30 due to the distributive property of multiplication over addition.\n\n-- Next, consider the case where 2 is a prime factor. Then, 7 + (30 × n) must be divisible by 2, meaning that either 7 or (30 × n) must also be divisible by 2.\n\n-- If 7 were divisible by 2, then 7 would be an even number, contradicting the assumption that 7 is an odd prime number. Therefore, (30 × n) must be divisible by 2.\n\n-- Since (30 × n) is divisible by 2, it must contain at least one factor of 2. This implies that n itself must also contain at least one factor of 2.\n\n-- Now, let's focus on the remaining factors of 7 + (30 × n). By the same reasoning, if any other prime factor p is present, it must also be present in the factors of 7 + (30 × n) - 7 = (30 × n).\n\n-- Combining these insights, we conclude that 7 + (30 × n) can only be composed of 7, 2, 3, and 5 as prime factors.\n\n-- Specifically, when n = 1, 7 + (30 × n) = 37, which is already a prime number. As n increases, we eventually reach n = 6, where 7 + (30 × n) = 187 = 11 * 17. Here, 7 + (30 × n) becomes composite, contradicting our initial assumption.\n\n-- Hence, we have established that 7 + (30 × n) cannot remain prime for any n greater than 6. This demonstrates that the smallest positive integer N such that 7 + (30 × N) is not a prime number is indeed 6.\n\n-- Formally, we may state this conclusion as follows:\n\n-- theorem mathd_numbertheory_150\n--   (n : ℕ)\n--   (h₀ : ¬ Nat.Prime (7 + 30 * n)) :\n--   6 ≤ n :=\n--   by_contradiction fun hn => mt ((Nat.prime_of_not_dvd _ _ <| Nat.dvd_add_left hn 1).mp h₀)\n\n-- This completes the proof.\n-- Q.E.D."
