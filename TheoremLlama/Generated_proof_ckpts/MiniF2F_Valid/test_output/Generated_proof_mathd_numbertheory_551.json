        "-- Determine the remainder of 1529 (mod 6). \n-- Show that it is 5.\n\n-- **Proof**\n\n-- We use the fact that `a ≡ b (mod c)` implies `a - b` is divisible by `c`.\n-- In particular, `(a - b) / c = q`.\n\n-- Here, `a = 1529`, `b =?`, and `c = 6`. \n\n-- After some calculation, we find `b = 254` such that `(1529 - 254) / 6 = 5`.\n-- This shows that `1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6)`.\n\n-- Formally:\n"
