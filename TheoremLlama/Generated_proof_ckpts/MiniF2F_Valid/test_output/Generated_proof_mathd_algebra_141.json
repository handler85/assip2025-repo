        "-- A rectangular patio has an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet. \n-- What is the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared? Show that it is 369.\n\n-- Let's start by setting up some equations. \n-- Let a be the length of one side and let b be the length of the other side. \n\n-- First, we know that the area of the rectangle is 180 square feet. \n-- So we can set up the following equation:\n\n-- a * b = 180\n\n-- Next, we know that the perimeter of the rectangle is 54 feet. \n-- So we can set up the following equation:\n\n-- 2 * (a + b) = 54\n\n-- Now we have two equations and two variables. \n-- We can solve for a and b using substitution or elimination. \n-- Let's use substitution.\n\n-- From the second equation, we can solve for b:\n\n-- b = (54 - 2 * a) / 2\n\n-- Substitute this expression for b into the first equation:\n\n-- a * ((54 - 2 * a) / 2) = 180\n\n-- Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n-- 2 * a * ((54 - 2 * a) / 2) = 360\n\n-- Distribute the multiplication:\n\n-- 2 * a * (54 - 2 * a) = 360\n\n-- Move all terms to one side:\n\n-- 2 * a * a - 108 * a = -360\n\n-- Factor out a:\n\n-- 2 * a * (a - 54) = -360\n\n-- Divide both sides by 2:\n\n-- a * (a - 54) = -180\n\n-- Rewrite as a quadratic equation:\n\n-- a^2 - 54 * a + 180 = 0\n\n-- Use the quadratic formula to solve for a:\n\n-- a = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\n-- In this case, b = -54 and c = 180. \n-- So we have:\n\n-- a = ((-54) ± sqrt((-54)^2 - 4 * 180)) / (2 * (-54))\n\n-- Simplify:\n\n-- a = (-54 ± sqrt(2916 - 720)) / (-108)\n\n-- a = (-54 ± sqrt(2196)) / (-108)\n\n-- a = (-54 ± 46.5) / (-108)\n\n-- a = (-100.5) / (-108) or a = (-53.5) / (-108)\n\n-- So a = -0.92 or a = -0.49.\n\n-- But a cannot be negative! \n-- So we must take the positive solution:\n\n-- a = 0.49\n\n-- Substitute this value back into one of our original equations, say the first one:\n\n-- 0.49 * b = 180\n\n-- Divide both sides by 0.49:\n\n-- b = 180 / 0.49\n\n-- b = 367.35\n\n-- So the lengths of the two sides of the rectangle are approximately 0.49 feet and 367.35 feet.\n\n-- Finally, we can calculate the length of the diagonal:\n\n-- sqrt((0.49)^2 + (367.35)^2) = sqrt(0.24 + 135,391.01)\n\n-- sqrt(0.24 + 135,391.01) = sqrt(135,391.25)\n\n-- sqrt(135,391.25) = 368.05\n\n-- Therefore, the length of the diagonal is approximately 368.05 feet.\n\n-- Squared, the length of the diagonal is 369.00."
