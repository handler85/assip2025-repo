    "Informal_proof": "We have that the remainder of the division of $x^5$ by $11$ is either $0$, $1$, or $10$: $x^5 \\equiv k \\mod 11$, with $k \\in {0, 1, -1}$.\nSimilarly, we observe that $y^2 \\equiv k \\mod 11$, with $k \\in {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, -2}$.\nSo $y^2 + 4 \\equiv k \\mod 11$, with $k \\in {4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 2}$.\nAs a result, $x^5$ and $y^2+4$ have different remainders when divided by $11$, and cannot be equal.",
