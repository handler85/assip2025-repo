Show that it is 8.\n\n-- We are asked to apply the function $f$ to the number $g(2)$.\n-- First, we need to find $g(2)$.\n-- We substitute $x=2$ into the expression given for $g$ to find that $g(2)=2^2+3=7$.\n-- Then we substitute $x=7$ into the expression for $f$ to find $f(7)=7+1=8$.\n\n-- Formally, we prove this using `simp` tactic. We provide the following arguments:\n\n-- - `f` and `g` are the functions we defined above.\n-- - `h₀` and `h₁` are proofs that these functions satisfy their respective definitions.\n-- - `rw [h₀, h₁, pow_succ']` rewrites the goal using the equations `h₀`, `h₁`, and `pow_succ'`.\n-- - `linarith` performs the necessary calculations using the resulting equations.\n\n-- Here's the formal proof:\n\n-- # Proof\n\n-- ## Args\n\n-- - `f`, `g`: functions defined above\n-- - `h₀`, `h₁`: proofs that `f` and `g` satisfy their respective definitions\n-- - `rw [h₀, h₁, pow_succ']`: rewrites the goal using the equations `h₀`, `h₁`, and `pow_succ'`\n-- - `linarith`: performs the necessary calculations using the resulting equations\n\n-- ## Formal Proof\n"
