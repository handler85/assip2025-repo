        "-- Let `x` and `y` be the two numbers, and let `x` be the larger one.\n-- Then we know that `x + y = 25` and `x - y = 11`, so we can solve for `x`.\n\n-- First, we add `y` to both sides of the second equation to get `x + y - y = 11`.\n-- But since `y` appears on both sides, we can subtract `y` from both sides again to get `x = 11 + y`.\n\n-- Next, we substitute this expression for `x` back into the first equation:\n-- `(11 + y) + y = 25`. We can combine like terms to get `12 + 2y = 25`.\n\n-- Finally, we subtract `12` from both sides to get `2y = 13`, and divide both sides by `2`\n-- to get `y = 13/2 = 6.5`. Since `y` is now known, we can substitute this back into\n-- the expression `x = 11 + y` to get `x = 11 + 6.5 = 17.5`.\n\n-- However, the question specifies that we should give the final answer as an integer,\n-- so we round `x` down to the nearest whole number. Since `17.5` is closer to `18`\n-- than it is to `17`, we conclude that `x = 18` is the correct solution.\n\n-- This completes the proof.\n-- \n-- # End of proof\n-- "
