    "Informal_proof": "We have that $2003 = 1 + 7 \\times 286$. So $4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \\iff 4x^3-1=7(y^3+286)$.\nWe also observe that for every integer $x$, the rest of the division of $x^3$ by $7$ is $0$, $1$, or $6$. So the rest of the division of $4x^3-1$ by $7$ is $6$, $3$, or $2$.\nAs a result, $7$ does not divide $4x^3-1$, but since $7(y^3+286)$ is divisible by $7$, the equation cannot have integers solutions.",
