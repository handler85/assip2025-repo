    "Informal_statement": "If a snack-size tin of peaches has $40$ calories and is $2\\%$ of a person's daily caloric requirement, how many calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement? Show that it is 2000.",
    "Informal_proof": "If 40 calories is equal to $2\\%=\\frac{2}{100}=\\frac{1}{50}$ of a person's daily requirement, then a person's daily caloric requirement is: $$40\\cdot 50=2000$$",
