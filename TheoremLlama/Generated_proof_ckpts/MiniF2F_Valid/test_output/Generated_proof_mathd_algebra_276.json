        "-- This theorem states that the expression `10x^2 - x - 24` can be factored as `(Ax-8)(Bx+3)`\n-- where A and B are integers.\n--\n-- Moreover, it calculates the sum `AB + B`, proving that it is indeed 12.\n\n-- Given an arbitrary real number x, the expression `10x^2 - x - 24` equals\n-- `(a * x - 8) * (b * x + 3)` according to the hypothesis `h₀`.\n\n-- To solve, we can try substituting specific values for A and B until the equality holds.\n-- In this case, setting `A = 5` and `B = 2` yields the desired result.\n\n-- Finally, adding the values `A = 5` and `B = 2` results in `12`, proving the theorem's conclusion.\n--\n-- References:\n--\n-- https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=10*x^2-x-24\n--"
