    "Informal_statement": "A $3491$ by $3491$ square has its length decreased by $60$ and its width increased by $60$.  By how much does its area change? Show that it is 3600.",
    "Informal_proof": "The new length is $3491-60$, and the new width is $3491+60$.  Thus, the new area is\n\n$$(3491-60)(3491+60)=3491^2-60^2$$$3491^2$ is the area of the original square.  So the change in area is $60^2=3600$.",
