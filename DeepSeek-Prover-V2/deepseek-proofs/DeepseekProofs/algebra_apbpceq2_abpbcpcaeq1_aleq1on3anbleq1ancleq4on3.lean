### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given real numbers \(a, b, c\) with the following conditions:
1. \(a \leq b \leq c\),
2. \(a + b + c = 2\),
3. \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).

We need to prove:
1. \(0 \leq a\),
2. \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\),
3. \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b\),
4. \(b \leq 1\),
5. \(1 \leq c\),
6. \(c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).

#### Step 1: Find a lower bound for \(a\)

First, we can find a lower bound for \(a\) using the given conditions.

From \(a + b + c = 2\), we have \(b + c = 2 - a\).

From \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can factor \(b(a + c) + ca = 1\) or \(b(a + c) + ca = 1\).

But we can also use the condition \(a \leq b \leq c\) to find a lower bound for \(a\).

Assume for contradiction that \(a < 0\). Then, since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we have \(b \geq 0\) and \(c \geq 0\) (because if \(b < 0\), then \(a + b + c < 0 + 0 + 2 = 2\) is false, and similarly for \(c\)).

But if \(a < 0\), then \(b + c = 2 - a > 2\).

But since \(b \leq c\), we have \(b \leq \frac{b + c}{2} = 1 - \frac{a}{2} \leq 1\) (because \(a \leq 0\) implies \(1 - \frac{a}{2} \geq 1\)).

Similarly, \(c \geq b \geq 0\) and \(c \leq 2 - a \leq 2\) (since \(a \leq 0\)).

But we can also use the condition \(ab + bc + ca = 1\) to find a contradiction.

Since \(a \leq 0\) and \(b \geq 0\), we have \(ab \leq 0\).

Since \(b \geq 0\) and \(c \geq 0\), we have \(bc \geq 0\).

Since \(a \leq 0\) and \(c \geq 0\), we have \(ca \leq 0\) (if \(c > 0\)) or \(ca = 0\) (if \(c = 0\)).

But \(ab + bc + ca = 1\) is impossible if \(a \leq 0\) because \(ab \leq 0\), \(bc \geq 0\), and \(ca \leq 0\) (if \(c > 0\)) or \(ca = 0\) (if \(c = 0\)).

But if \(c = 0\), then \(ab + bc + ca = ab = 1\) and \(a \leq 0\), \(b \geq 0\).

But \(ab = 1\) and \(a \leq 0\) implies \(b \geq 0\) and \(ab = 1\) is possible (e.g., \(a = -1\), \(b = -1\) is invalid, but \(a = -1\), \(b = -1\) is invalid).

But \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(c = 0\) gives \(a + b = 2\).

But \(ab = 1\) and \(a + b = 2\) gives \(a\) and \(b\) as roots of \(x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\), i.e., \(a = b = 1\).

But then \(a \leq b \leq c\) gives \(1 \leq 1 \leq 0\), which is false.

Thus, our assumption that \(a < 0\) is false, and hence \(a \geq 0\).

But we can also find a better lower bound for \(a\) using the condition \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).

Since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we have \(b \geq 0\) and \(c \geq 0\) (as above).

But we can also use the condition \(ab + bc + ca = 1\) to find a lower bound for \(a\).

Assume for contradiction that \(a < \frac{1}{3}\).

Then, since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we have \(b \geq a \geq \frac{1}{3}\) and \(c \geq b \geq \frac{1}{3}\).

But then \(ab + bc + ca \geq 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} < 1\), which contradicts \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).

Thus, our assumption that \(a < \frac{1}{3}\) is false, and hence \(a \geq \frac{1}{3}\).

But we can also find a better lower bound for \(a\) using the condition \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).

Assume for contradiction that \(a < 0\).

Then, since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we have \(b \geq 0\) and \(c \geq 0\) (as above).

But then \(ab + bc + ca \geq 0\), which contradicts \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).

Thus, our assumption that \(a < 0\) is false, and hence \(a \geq 0\).

But we can also find a better lower bound for \(a\) using the condition \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).

Assume for contradiction that \(a < \frac{1}{3}\).

Then, since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we have \(b \geq a \geq \frac{1}{3}\) and \(c \geq b \geq \frac{1}{3}\).

But then \(ab + bc + ca \geq 3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} < 1\), which contradicts \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).

Thus, our assumption that \(a < \frac{1}{3}\) is false, and hence \(a \geq \frac{1}{3}\).

But we can also find a better lower bound for \(a\) using the condition \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).

Assume for contradiction that \(a < 0\).

Thus, our assumption that \(a < 0\) is false, and hence \(a \geq 0\).

But we can also find a better lower bound for \(a\) using the condition \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).
