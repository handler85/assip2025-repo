/- ### Detailed Proof

**Problem:** Given real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that:
1. \( 3a + 2b = 5 \),
2. \( a + b = 2 \),

prove that \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 1 \).

**Approach:**
We can solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using the given equations. Here are the steps:

1. From the second equation \( a + b = 2 \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):
   \[ b = 2 - a. \]

2. Substitute \( b = 2 - a \) into the first equation \( 3a + 2b = 5 \):
   \[ 3a + 2(2 - a) = 5. \]
   Simplify the left-hand side:
   \[ 3a + 4 - 2a = 5, \]
   \[ a + 4 = 5, \]
   \[ a = 1. \]

3. Substitute \( a = 1 \) back into \( b = 2 - a \):
   \[ b = 2 - 1 = 1. \]

Thus, the solution is \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 1 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):**
   - From \( a + b = 2 \), we get \( b = 2 - a \).

2. **Substitute \( b \) into the first equation:**
   - Substitute \( b = 2 - a \) into \( 3a + 2b = 5 \).
   - Simplify to find \( a = 1 \).

3. **Find \( b \):**
   - Substitute \( a = 1 \) back into \( b = 2 - a \) to get \( b = 1 \).

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check that both original equations are satisfied with \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 1 \).
