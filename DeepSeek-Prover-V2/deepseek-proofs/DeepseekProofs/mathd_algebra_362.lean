/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given two equations:
1. \( a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \)
2. \( \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \)

We need to find \( a + b \).

#### Step 1: Simplify the second equation
The second equation is \( \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \). This can be rewritten as:
\[ a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \]

#### Step 2: Substitute \( a \) into the first equation
The first equation is \( a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \). Substitute \( a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \):
\[ \left( \frac{27}{4} b^3 \right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \]
\[ \frac{729}{16} b^6 \cdot b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \]
\[ \frac{729}{16} b^9 = \frac{32}{27} \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( b^9 \)
Multiply both sides by \( 16 \cdot 27 \):
\[ 729 \cdot 27 b^9 = 32 \cdot 16 \]
\[ 19683 b^9 = 512 \]
\[ b^9 = \frac{512}{19683} \]
\[ b^9 = \left( \frac{8}{27} \right)^3 \]
\[ b^9 = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^6 \]

This is not immediately helpful, but we can take the cube root:
\[ b^3 = \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ b = \frac{2}{3} \]

#### Step 4: Find \( a \)
Substitute \( b = \frac{2}{3} \) back into \( a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \):
\[ a = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \]
\[ a = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{8}{27} \]
\[ a = \frac{216}{108} \]
\[ a = 2 \]

#### Step 5: Find \( a + b \)
\[ a + b = 2 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \]

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the second equation**:
   - Start with \( \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \).
   - Rearrange to \( a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \).

2. **Substitute into the first equation**:
   - Substitute \( a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \) into \( a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \).
   - Simplify to \( \frac{729}{16} b^6 \cdot b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \).
   - Further simplify to \( \frac{729}{16} b^9 = \frac{32}{27} \).

3. **Solve for \( b^9 \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by \( 16 \cdot 27 \) to eliminate denominators.
   - Simplify to \( 729 \cdot 27 b^9 = 32 \cdot 16 \).
   - Further simplify to \( 19683 b^9 = 512 \).
   - Take the cube root to find \( b^3 = \frac{2}{3} \).

4. **Find \( a \)**:
   - Substitute \( b^3 = \frac{2}{3} \) back into \( a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \).
   - Simplify to \( a = 2 \).

5. **Find \( a + b \)**:
   - Add \( a = 2 \) and \( b = \frac{2}{3} \) to get \( a + b = \frac{8}{3} \).
