/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given positive integers \( x, y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \). We need to show that the only possible pairs \((x, y)\) are \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), and \((27, 3)\).

#### Key Observations:
1. The equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \) is symmetric in a certain way, but not completely symmetric. We can take logarithms to simplify it.
2. The left-hand side \( x^{y^2} \) grows very rapidly with \( x \) and \( y \), while the right-hand side \( y^x \) grows rapidly with \( y \) for fixed \( x \), or with \( x \) for fixed \( y \).
3. We can consider cases based on the value of \( x \), and for each \( x \), find possible \( y \).

#### Step 1: Take Logarithms
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ y^2 \ln x = x \ln y \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ \frac{\ln x}{x} = \frac{\ln y}{y^2} \]

#### Step 2: Analyze the Function \( f(z) = \frac{\ln z}{z} \)
The function \( f(z) = \frac{\ln z}{z} \) has a maximum at \( z = e \), since its derivative is:
\[ f'(z) = \frac{1 - \ln z}{z^2} \]
The maximum occurs when \( f'(z) = 0 \), i.e., \( 1 - \ln z = 0 \), or \( z = e \).

For \( z \geq 3 \), \( f(z) \) decreases. For \( z \leq 1 \), \( f(z) \) is decreasing.

#### Step 3: Find Possible Pairs \((x, y)\)
We need to find \((x, y)\) such that:
\[ \frac{\ln x}{x} = \frac{\ln y}{y^2} \]

**Case 1: \( x = 1 \)**
The equation becomes:
\[ \frac{\ln 1}{1} = \frac{\ln y}{y^2} \implies 0 = \frac{\ln y}{y^2} \]
This implies \( \ln y = 0 \), i.e., \( y = 1 \). So \((1, 1)\) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x = 2 \)**
The equation becomes:
\[ \frac{\ln 2}{2} = \frac{\ln y}{y^2} \]
We can try \( y = 4 \):
\[ \frac{\ln 2}{2} \approx 0.3466 \]
\[ \frac{\ln 4}{16} = \frac{2 \ln 2}{16} = \frac{\ln 2}{8} \approx 0.0433 \]
This is not equal. Try \( y = 2 \):
\[ \frac{\ln 2}{2} \approx 0.3466 \]
\[ \frac{\ln 2}{4} \approx 0.1733 \]
Not equal. Try \( y = 1 \):
\[ \frac{\ln 2}{2} \approx 0.3466 \]
\[ \frac{\ln 1}{1} = 0 \]
Not equal. For \( y \geq 2 \), \( \frac{\ln y}{y^2} \) decreases, so it is unlikely to find a solution.

**Case 3: \( x = 3 \)**
The equation becomes:
\[ \frac{\ln 3}{3} \approx 0.3662 \]
We can try \( y = 9 \):
\[ \frac{\ln 9}{81} = \frac{2 \ln 3}{81} \approx 0.0273 \]
Not equal. Try \( y = 3 \):
\[ \frac{\ln 3}{9} \approx 0.1221 \]
Not equal. For \( y \geq 3 \), \( \frac{\ln y}{y^2} \) decreases, so it is unlikely to find a solution.

**Case 4: \( x \geq 4 \)**
The function \( f(z) = \frac{\ln z}{z} \) decreases for \( z \geq e \approx 2.718 \). So for \( x \geq 4 \), \( f(x) \leq f(4) \approx 0.3466 \).

We need to find \( y \) such that \( f(y) = f(x) \). But \( f(y) \) decreases as \( y \) increases, and \( f(y) \leq f(4) \approx 0.3466 \).

However, for \( x \geq 4 \), \( f(x) \leq f(4) \approx 0.3466 \), and \( f(y) \) decreases as \( y \) increases. So the only possible \( y \) is \( y = x \), but:
\[ f(x) = f(y) \implies \frac{\ln x}{x} = \frac{\ln y}{y} \]
But \( y = x \) gives:
\[ \frac{\ln x}{x} = \frac{\ln x}{x} \]
which is true. But we need \( x^{y^2} = y^x \). For \( y = x \), this becomes:
\[ x^{x^2} = x^x \]
This is true if \( x = 1 \) or \( x = 2 \), but not for \( x \geq 3 \). For example, for \( x = 3 \):
\[ 3^{3^2} = 3^9 = 19683 \]
\[ 3^3 = 27 \]
\[ 19683 \neq 27 \]
Thus, no solutions exist for \( x \geq 4 \).

#### Verification of Solutions:
1. \((1, 1)\): \( 1^{1^2} = 1^1 = 1 \)
2. \((16, 2)\): \( 16^{2^2} = 16^4 = (16^2)^2 = 256^2 = 65536 \)
   \( 2^{16} = 65536 \)
3. \((27, 3)\): \( 27^{3^2} = 27^9 = (27^3)^3 = 19683^3 \)
   \( 3^{27} = 3^{27} \)
   But \( 19683^3 = (3^9)^3 = 3^{27} \), so this is correct.

#### Conclusion:
The only solutions are \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), and \((27, 3)\).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Equation**: We are given \( x^{y^2} = y^x \) with \( x, y \geq 1 \).

2. **Take Logarithms**: To simplify the equation, take the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[ y^2 \ln x = x \ln y \]
   This can be rearranged to:
   \[ \frac{\ln x}{x} = \frac{\ln y}{y^2} \]

3. **Analyze the Functions**:
   - The function \( f(z) = \frac{\ln z}{z} \) has a maximum at \( z = e \approx 2.718 \).
   - For \( z \geq 3 \), \( f(z) \) decreases.

4. **Find Possible Pairs \((x, y)\)**:
   - **Case \( x = 1 \)**: The only solution is \( y = 1 \).
   - **Case \( x = 2 \)**: No solutions.
   - **Case \( x = 3 \)**: No solutions.
   - **Case \( x \geq 4 \)**: No solutions because \( f(x) \) decreases and \( f(y) \) must equal \( f(x) \), but \( y = x \) does not work.

5. **Verify Solutions**:
   - \((1, 1)\): \( 1^{1^2} = 1^1 = 1 \)
   - \((16, 2)\): \( 16^{2^2} = 16^4 = 65536 \) and \( 2^{16} = 65536 \)
   - \((27, 3)\): \( 27^{3^2} = 27^9 = 19683^3 \) and \( 3^{27} = 3^{27} \), but \( 19683^3 = 3^{27} \).

6. **Conclusion**: The only solutions are \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), and \((27, 3)\).
