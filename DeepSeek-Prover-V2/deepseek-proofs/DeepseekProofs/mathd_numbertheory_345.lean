/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem:
We need to find the remainder when the sum \(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006\) is divided by 7. 

#### Step 1: Compute the Sum
First, compute the sum:
\[
2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006
\]
This is an arithmetic series with 7 terms, where the first term \(a_1 = 2000\) and the common difference \(d = 1\). The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)
\]
For \(n = 7\), \(a_1 = 2000\), and \(d = 1\):
\[
S = \frac{7}{2} (2 \cdot 2000 + 6 \cdot 1) = \frac{7}{2} (4000 + 6) = \frac{7}{2} \cdot 4006 = 7 \cdot 2003 = 14021
\]
So, the sum is \(14021\).

#### Step 2: Find the Remainder When Divided by 7
Now, we need to find \(14021 \mod 7\). 

First, note that \(14000 = 7 \times 2000\), so \(14000 \mod 7 = 0\). 

Thus, \(14021 \mod 7 = (14000 + 21) \mod 7 = (0 + 21) \mod 7 = 21 \mod 7 = 0\).

Therefore, the remainder is \(0\).

### Step 3: Abstract Plan

1. **Compute the Sum**:
   - Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series \(2000 + 2001 + \dots + 2006\) to get \(14021\).

2. **Find the Remainder Modulo 7**:
   - Break down \(14021\) into \(14000 + 21\).
   - Since \(14000\) is divisible by \(7\), the remainder is the same as \(21 \mod 7\).
   - Compute \(21 \mod 7 = 0\).

### Step 4: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```
