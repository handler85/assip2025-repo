### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem and the given conditions.

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function \( f \) is defined on the set of positive rational numbers.
   - It satisfies the multiplicative property: \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - For every prime number \( p \), \( f(p) = p \).

2. **Goal**:
   - Prove that \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) < 0 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Functional Equation
The functional equation \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) is similar to the logarithm function, which satisfies \( \log(a \cdot b) = \log(a) + \log(b) \). However, the logarithm is defined for positive real numbers, and our function is defined for positive rational numbers.

But the problem gives us a specific condition \( f(p) = p \) for every prime \( p \). This suggests that \( f \) is the identity function on primes.

#### Step 2: Find \( f(1) \)
Using the multiplicative property with \( a = b = 1 \), we get:
\[ f(1 \cdot 1) = f(1) + f(1) \implies f(1) = 2 f(1) \implies f(1) = 0. \]

#### Step 3: Find \( f(0) \)
This is a bit tricky. The problem states that \( f \) is defined on positive rational numbers, but Lean's `h₀` is stated for all `x > 0` and `y > 0`, and `f : ℚ → ℝ`.

But in Lean, `f : ℚ → ℝ`, and `h₀` is `∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x * y) = f x + f y`.

But if we take `x = 0`, `y = 1`, then `x * y = 0`, but `x > 0` is false, so this is not a problem.

But if we take `x = 1`, `y = 0`, then `x * y = 0`, but `y > 0` is false, so this is not a problem.

But if we take `x = 1`, `y = 1`, then `x * y = 1`, and `f(1) = 0` is correct.

But if we take `x = 1`, `y = 2`, then `x * y = 2`, and `f(2) = f(1) + f(2) = 0 + f(2) = f(2)`.

But we don't know `f(2)` yet.

But we can find `f(2)` using the multiplicative property.

Take `x = 2`, `y = 1/2`, then `x * y = 1`, and `f(1) = 0 = f(2) + f(1/2) = f(2) + f(1/2)`.

But we don't know `f(1/2)`.

But we can find `f(1/2)` using the multiplicative property.

Take `x = 1/2`, `y = 2`, then `x * y = 1`, and `f(1) = 0 = f(1/2) + f(2) = f(1/2) + f(2)`.

But we already have `f(2) = f(1) + f(2) = 0 + f(2) = f(2)`, which is not helpful.

This suggests that we need to find `f(1/2)` and `f(2)` in terms of other values.

But we can find `f(1/2)` using the multiplicative property.

Take `x = 1/2`, `y = 1/2`, then `x * y = 1/4`, and `f(1/4) = f(1/2) + f(1/2) = 2 f(1/2)`.

But we don't know `f(1/4)`.

But we can find `f(1/4)` using the multiplicative property.
