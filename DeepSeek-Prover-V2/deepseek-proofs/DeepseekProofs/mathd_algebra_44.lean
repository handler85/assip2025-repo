/- ### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have two equations:
1. \( s = 9 - 2t \)
2. \( t = 3s + 1 \)

We need to find the values of \( s \) and \( t \) that satisfy both equations simultaneously. The solution is claimed to be \( s = 1 \) and \( t = 4 \).

**Approach:**
To find the intersection point, we can substitute the expression for \( s \) from the first equation into the second equation and solve for \( t \). Alternatively, we can substitute the expression for \( t \) from the second equation into the first equation and solve for \( s \). Here, we will use the first approach.

**Step 1: Substitute \( s = 9 - 2t \) into \( t = 3s + 1 \).**

This gives:
\[ t = 3(9 - 2t) + 1 \]
\[ t = 27 - 6t + 1 \]
\[ t = 28 - 6t \]

**Step 2: Solve for \( t \).**

Add \( 6t \) to both sides:
\[ t + 6t = 28 \]
\[ 7t = 28 \]
\[ t = 4 \]

**Step 3: Find \( s \) using \( s = 9 - 2t \).**

Substitute \( t = 4 \):
\[ s = 9 - 2 \cdot 4 \]
\[ s = 9 - 8 \]
\[ s = 1 \]

**Verification:**
Check the second equation with \( s = 1 \) and \( t = 4 \):
\[ t = 3s + 1 \]
\[ 4 = 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \]
\[ 4 = 3 + 1 \]
\[ 4 = 4 \]
This is correct.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Substitute \( s = 9 - 2t \) into \( t = 3s + 1 \):**
   - This gives \( t = 3(9 - 2t) + 1 \).

2. **Expand and simplify the equation:**
   - \( t = 27 - 6t + 1 \).
   - \( t = 28 - 6t \).

3. **Solve for \( t \):**
   - Add \( 6t \) to both sides: \( 7t = 28 \).
   - Divide by 7: \( t = 4 \).

4. **Find \( s \) using \( s = 9 - 2t \):**
   - Substitute \( t = 4 \): \( s = 9 - 8 = 1 \).

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check \( t = 3s + 1 \) with \( s = 1 \) and \( t = 4 \).
