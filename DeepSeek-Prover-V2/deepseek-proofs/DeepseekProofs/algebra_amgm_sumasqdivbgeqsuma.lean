### Detailed Proof and Analysis

We are given four positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d > 0\) and need to prove the inequality:
\[
\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d.
\]

#### Key Observations:
1. The inequality resembles the **Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM)** inequality, but is not directly AM-GM.
2. The denominators and numerators are cyclically permuted.
3. The terms \(\frac{a^2}{b}\) and \(\frac{b}{a}\) are related by AM-GM, but we need a more refined approach.

#### Proof Sketch:
We will use the **Titu's Lemma** (a special case of Cauchy-Schwarz) and the **AM-GM inequality** to bound each term.

1. For each term \(\frac{x^2}{y}\), we can write:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{y} = x \cdot \frac{x}{y}.
   \]
   By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
   \[
   \frac{x}{y} + \frac{y}{x} \geq 2.
   \]
   However, this is not directly helpful for our problem. Instead, we can use the following approach:

2. For each term \(\frac{x^2}{y}\), we can write:
   \[
   \frac{x^2}{y} = \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{y} - \frac{y^2}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{y} + \frac{y^2}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{x}.
   \]
   This seems too complicated. A better approach is to use the **rearrangement inequality** or **Chebyshev's inequality**, but it is not straightforward.

3. Alternatively, we can use the **weighted AM-GM inequality** to bound each term. For example, for \(\frac{a^2}{b}\), we can write:
   \[
   \frac{a^2}{b} + b \geq 2a,
   \]
   by the AM-GM inequality applied to \(\frac{a^2}{b}\) and \(b\). Similarly for the other terms. Summing these four inequalities gives:
   \[
   \left(\frac{a^2}{b} + b\right) + \left(\frac{b^2}{c} + c\right) + \left(\frac{c^2}{d} + d\right) + \left(\frac{d^2}{a} + a\right) \geq 2(a + b + c + d).
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   \left(\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a}\right) + (a + b + c + d) \geq 2(a + b + c + d).
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d,
   \]
   which is the desired inequality.

#### Verification of the AM-GM Steps:
For each term \(\frac{x^2}{y}\), we have:
\[
\frac{x^2}{y} + y \geq 2\sqrt{\frac{x^2}{y} \cdot y} = 2x,
\]
by the AM-GM inequality, since \(\frac{x^2}{y} \cdot y = x^2\) and \(\sqrt{x^2} = x\) (for \(x > 0\)).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Apply AM-GM to Each Fraction**:
   - For each fraction \(\frac{x^2}{y}\), add \(y\) to it to get \(\frac{x^2}{y} + y \geq 2x\).
   - Similarly for the other fractions.

2. **Sum the Inequalities**:
   - Sum the four inequalities obtained from the AM-GM steps to get:
     \[
     \left(\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a}\right) + (a + b + c + d) \geq 2(a + b + c + d).
     \]

3. **Simplify and Rearrange**:
   - Subtract \((a + b + c + d)\) from both sides to get:
     \[
     \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d.
     \]
