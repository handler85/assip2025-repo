/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's carefully restate the problem and the goal.

**Problem Statement:**
Find all real numbers \( x \) such that:
1. \( 0 \leq 3 - x \) (i.e., \( x \leq 3 \)),
2. \( 0 \leq x + 1 \) (i.e., \( x \geq -1 \)),
3. \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1}} > \frac{1}{2} \).

The solution is claimed to be \( x \in [-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}) \).

**Approach:**
1. Understand the domain of the inequality.
   - From \( 0 \leq 3 - x \), we get \( x \leq 3 \).
   - From \( 0 \leq x + 1 \), we get \( x \geq -1 \).
   - So, the domain is \( x \in [-1, 3] \).

2. Simplify the inequality \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1}} > \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Square both sides (since both sides are positive):
     \[ \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > \frac{1}{4}. \]
   - Rearrange:
     \[ \sqrt{3 - x} > \sqrt{x + 1} + \frac{1}{4}. \]
   - Square again (note that \( \sqrt{x + 1} + \frac{1}{4} \geq 0 \) is always true because \( x \geq -1 \)):
     \[ 3 - x > x + 1 + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{x + 1}) \cdot \frac{1}{4}, \]
     but this seems complicated. A better approach is to consider the original inequality and directly work with it.

3. A better approach is to consider the original inequality and find bounds.
   - The condition \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1}} > \frac{1}{2} \) is equivalent to:
     \[ \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > \frac{1}{4}, \]
     because \( \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > 0 \) is implied by the original inequality (since the square root is always non-negative and the expression inside the square root is non-negative).
   - Square both sides again:
     \[ 3 - x - (x + 1) + 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > \frac{1}{16}, \]
     \[ 2 - 2x + 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > \frac{1}{16}, \]
     \[ 2 - 2x + 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > \frac{1}{16}, \]
     \[ 2 - 2x + 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > \frac{1}{16}. \]
   - This seems too complicated. Let's instead consider the original inequality and find bounds for \( x \).

4. Find bounds for \( x \).
   - The condition \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1}} > \frac{1}{2} \) is equivalent to:
     \[ \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > \frac{1}{4}. \]
   - Square both sides:
     \[ 3 - x - (x + 1) + 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > \frac{1}{16}, \]
     \[ 2 - 2x + 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > \frac{1}{16}, \]
     \[ 2 - 2x + 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > \frac{1}{16}. \]
   - Rearrange:
     \[ 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > 2x - 2 + \frac{1}{16}, \]
     \[ 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > 2x - \frac{31}{16}. \]
   - Since \( x \geq -1 \), \( 2x - \frac{31}{16} \leq 2(-1) - \frac{31}{16} = -2 - \frac{31}{16} = -\frac{62}{16} - \frac{31}{16} = -\frac{93}{16} \).
   - But \( 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} \geq 0 \), and \( 2x - \frac{31}{16} \leq -\frac{93}{16} \). So the inequality \( 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > 2x - \frac{31}{16} \) is trivially satisfied because the LHS is always non-negative and the RHS is always less than or equal to \( -\frac{93}{16} \).

   - This suggests that the original condition is always satisfied, but this is not the case. The mistake is in the last step. The correct approach is to find the correct bounds for \( x \).

5. Correct bounds for \( x \).
   - The condition \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1}} > \frac{1}{2} \) is equivalent to:
     \[ \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > \frac{1}{4}. \]
   - Square both sides:
     \[ 3 - x - (x + 1) + 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > \frac{1}{16}, \]
     \[ 2 - 2x + 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > \frac{1}{16}, \]
     \[ 2 - 2x + 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > \frac{1}{16}. \]
   - Rearrange:
     \[ 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > 2x - \frac{31}{16}. \]
   - Since \( x \geq -1 \), \( 2x - \frac{31}{16} \leq 2(-1) - \frac{31}{16} = -2 - \frac{31}{16} = -\frac{62}{16} - \frac{31}{16} = -\frac{93}{16} \).
   - The LHS \( 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} \) is minimized when \( x \) is maximized, i.e., when \( x = 3 \). At \( x = 3 \), \( 2 \sqrt{(3 - 3)(3 + 1)} = 0 \).
   - The RHS \( 2x - \frac{31}{16} \) is minimized when \( x \) is minimized, i.e., when \( x = -1 \). At \( x = -1 \), \( 2(-1) - \frac{31}{16} = -2 - \frac{31}{16} = -\frac{62}{16} - \frac{31}{16} = -\frac{93}{16} \).
   - Thus, the inequality \( 2 \sqrt{(3 - x)(x + 1)} > 2x - \frac{31}{16} \) is equivalent to \( 0 \geq 2x - \frac{31}{16} \), i.e., \( x \leq \frac{31}{32} \).

   - Therefore, the original condition is equivalent to:
     \[ -1 \leq x \leq \frac{31}{32}. \]
   - But we need to check the boundary \( x = \frac{31}{32} \).
     - At \( x = \frac{31}{32} \), \( \sqrt{3 - x} = \sqrt{3 - \frac{31}{32}} = \sqrt{\frac{96 - 31}{32}} = \sqrt{\frac{65}{32}} \),
       \( \sqrt{x + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{31}{32} + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{63}{32}} \),
       \( \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} = \sqrt{\frac{65}{32}} - \sqrt{\frac{63}{32}} \approx 1.42 - 1.40 = 0.02 \),
       \( \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \),
       so \( \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > \frac{1}{4} \) is satisfied.
   - Thus, the correct solution is:
     \[ -1 \leq x \leq \frac{31}{32}. \]

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Domain**:
   - The domain of the inequality is \( x \in [-1, 3] \).

2. **Simplify the Inequality**:
   - The original inequality is equivalent to \( \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > \frac{1}{4} \).

3. **Find Bounds for \( x \)**:
   - Square both sides to eliminate the square roots, but this leads to a complicated inequality.
   - Instead, find the minimum and maximum of \( \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} \) to determine the bounds.
   - The minimum of \( \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} \) is \( 0 \) (at \( x = 3 \)) and the maximum is \( \sqrt{65/32} - \sqrt{63/32} \approx 0.02 \) (at \( x = \frac{31}{32} \)).
   - The inequality \( \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > \frac{1}{4} \) is satisfied for all \( x \in [-1, \frac{31}{32}] \).

4. **Final Solution**:
   - The solution to the original inequality is \( x \in [-1, \frac{31}{32}] \).
