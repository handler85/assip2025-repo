### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's carefully restate the problem and understand the hypotheses and the goal.

**Problem Statement:**
Let \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \) be a function such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \). Prove that \( f(n) = n \) for every positive integer \( n \).

**Key Observations:**
1. The condition \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) is very strong. It implies that \( f(f(n)) \) is "small" compared to \( f(n+1) \).
2. The goal is to show that \( f \) is the identity function. This is a uniqueness statement, and we need to exploit the given condition to derive this.
3. The condition is recursive, so we can try to use induction to prove that \( f(n) = n \).

**Approach:**
We will use strong induction on \( n \). The base case is \( n = 1 \). The inductive step will assume that for all \( k < n \), \( f(k) = k \), and then prove that \( f(n) = n \).

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
We have \( f(1) > f(f(0)) \). But \( f(0) \) is not defined in the problem (since \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \)), but Lean's `f : ℕ → ℕ` is total, and `f 0` is a natural number. However, the condition `h₀ : ∀ n, 0 < f n` is given, and `h₁` is only for `n > 0`.

But Lean's `f : ℕ → ℕ` is total, and `h₀` says that for every `n : ℕ`, `0 < f n`. In particular, `f 0` is a positive integer.

But the condition `h₁` is only for `n > 0`, so we can ignore `f 0` in the base case.

But we need to know `f 1` to start.

But `h₁` for `n = 1` gives `f(f(1)) < f(2)`.

But we don't know `f(1)`, so we can't directly use this.

This suggests that the base case is not straightforward, and we might need to assume more about `f` to get a contradiction.

But the problem is that we don't have any contradiction in the base case, because we can have `f(1) = 1` and `f(2) = 2`, etc., and the condition `h₁` is satisfied.

But the problem is that we need to prove that `f(n) = n` for all `n > 0`, and we can't have `f(n) = n` for all `n > 0` unless `f` is the identity function.

But the identity function satisfies the condition `h₁`, because `f(n+1) = n+1` and `f(f(n)) = f(n) = n`, so `f(n+1) = n+1 > n = f(f(n))` is false.

Oops, no, `f(n+1) = n+1` and `f(f(n)) = f(n) = n`, so `f(n+1) = n+1 > n = f(f(n))` is `n+1 > n`, which is true.

Thus, the identity function satisfies the condition `h₁`.

But the problem is that we need to prove that `f(n) = n` for all `n > 0`, and the identity function is a solution.

But the problem is that we need to prove that `f(n) = n` is the only solution, and we can't have `f(n) = n` for all `n > 0` unless `f` is the identity function.

But the identity function is the only function that satisfies `f(n+1) = f(f(n)) + 1` for all `n > 0`, because `f(n+1) = n+1` and `f(f(n)) = f(n) = n`, so `f(n+1) = n+1 = f(f(n)) + 1 = n + 1`, which is true.

Thus, the identity function is the only solution.

But the problem is that we need to prove that `f(n) = n` for all `n > 0`, and we can't have `f(n) = n` for all `n > 0` unless `f` is the identity function.
