/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem:
We have real numbers \(a, b, c, d\) such that:
1. \(4^a = 5\),
2. \(5^b = 6\),
3. \(6^c = 7\),
4. \(7^d = 8\).

We need to prove that \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{3}{2}\).

#### Step 1: Take Natural Logarithms
To solve for \(a\), take the natural logarithm of both sides of \(4^a = 5\):
\[
a \ln 4 = \ln 5 \implies a = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4}.
\]
Similarly, for the other equations:
1. \(b = \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5}\),
2. \(c = \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6}\),
3. \(d = \frac{\ln 8}{\ln 7}\).

#### Step 2: Compute the Product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\)
Substitute the expressions for \(a, b, c, d\):
\[
a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdot \frac{\ln 8}{\ln 7}.
\]
Simplify the product:
\[
a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{\ln 5 \cdot \ln 6 \cdot \ln 7 \cdot \ln 8}{\ln 4 \cdot \ln 5 \cdot \ln 6 \cdot \ln 7}.
\]
Further simplification:
\[
a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{\ln 8}{\ln 4} = \frac{\ln (2^3)}{\ln (2^2)} = \frac{3 \ln 2}{2 \ln 2} = \frac{3}{2}.
\]

#### Step 3: Verification
The simplification is correct because:
\[
\ln 8 = \ln (2^3) = 3 \ln 2, \quad \ln 4 = \ln (2^2) = 2 \ln 2.
\]
Thus, the product simplifies to \(\frac{3}{2}\).

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Take Logarithms**:
   - For each equation \(x^y = z\), take the natural logarithm to get \(y \ln x = \ln z\).
   - Solve for \(y\) to get \(y = \frac{\ln z}{\ln x}\).

2. **Substitute Values**:
   - Substitute the expressions for \(a, b, c, d\) into \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\).

3. **Simplify the Product**:
   - Cancel common terms in the numerator and denominator.
   - Use logarithm identities to simplify the remaining expression.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Compute the simplified form to get \(\frac{3}{2}\).
