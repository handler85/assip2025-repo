/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem. We are given integers `a` and `b` such that for all real numbers `x`, the polynomial identity `10x² - x - 24 = (a x - 8)(b x + 3)` holds. We need to prove that `a * b + b = 12`.

#### Step 1: Expand the Right-Hand Side
First, expand the right-hand side `(a x - 8)(b x + 3)`:
\[
(a x - 8)(b x + 3) = a x \cdot b x + a x \cdot 3 - 8 \cdot b x - 8 \cdot 3 = a b x^2 + 3 a x - 8 b x - 24.
\]
So, the identity becomes:
\[
10 x^2 - x - 24 = a b x^2 + (3 a - 8 b) x - 24.
\]

#### Step 2: Compare Coefficients
Since the above holds for all real `x`, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of `x` on both sides.

1. **Coefficient of `x²`:**
   \[
   10 = a b.
   \]
2. **Coefficient of `x`:**
   \[
   -1 = 3 a - 8 b.
   \]
3. **Constant term:**
   \[
   -24 = -24.
   \]
   This is trivially satisfied and does not provide new information.

#### Step 3: Solve the System of Equations
We now have:
1. \( a b = 10 \),
2. \( 3 a - 8 b = -1 \).

We can solve for `a` in terms of `b` or vice versa.

From \( a b = 10 \), we get \( a = \frac{10}{b} \). Substitute into the second equation:
\[
3 \cdot \frac{10}{b} - 8 b = -1.
\]
Multiply through by `b` to eliminate the denominator:
\[
30 - 8 b^2 = -b.
\]
Rearrange:
\[
8 b^2 - b - 30 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic equation in `b`. Solve using the quadratic formula:
\[
b = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 960}}{16} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{961}}{16} = \frac{1 \pm 31}{16}.
\]
This gives two solutions:
1. \( b = \frac{1 + 31}{16} = \frac{32}{16} = 2 \),
2. \( b = \frac{1 - 31}{16} = \frac{-30}{16} = -\frac{15}{8} \).

#### Step 4: Find Corresponding `a` Values
1. If \( b = 2 \), then \( a = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \).
2. If \( b = -\frac{15}{8} \), then \( a = \frac{10}{-\frac{15}{8}} = 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{8}{15}\right) = -\frac{80}{15} = -\frac{16}{3} \).

#### Step 5: Compute `a * b + b` for Each Case
1. For \( a = 5 \), \( b = 2 \):
   \[
   a b + b = 5 \cdot 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12.
   \]
2. For \( a = -\frac{16}{3} \), \( b = -\frac{15}{8} \):
   \[
   a b + b = \left(-\frac{16}{3}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{15}{8}\right) + \left(-\frac{15}{8}\right) = \frac{240}{24} - \frac{15}{8} = 10 - \frac{15}{8} = \frac{80}{8} - \frac{15}{8} = \frac{65}{8} \neq 12.
   \]
   However, this contradicts our earlier assumption that `b = -15/8` is a valid solution. Let's re-examine the quadratic equation:
   \[
   8 b^2 - b - 30 = 0.
   \]
   The discriminant is `D = 1 + 960 = 961 = 31²`, so the roots are:
   \[
   b = \frac{1 \pm 31}{16}.
   \]
   This gives:
   1. `b = (1 + 31)/16 = 32/16 = 2`,
   2. `b = (1 - 31)/16 = -30/16 = -15/8`.

   For `b = 2`, `a = 5`, and `a * b + b = 12` is correct. For `b = -15/8`, `a = -16/3`, and `a * b + b = (-16/3)*(-15/8) + (-15/8) = 10 - 15/8 = 65/8 ≠ 12`.

   Therefore, the only valid solution is `a = 5`, `b = 2`, and `a * b + b = 12`.

#### Step 6: Verification
Substitute `a = 5`, `b = 2` back into the original identity:
\[
10 x^2 - x - 24 = (5 x - 8)(2 x + 3) = 10 x^2 + 15 x - 16 x - 24 = 10 x^2 - x - 24.
\]
This holds true for all real `x`, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Expand the Right-Hand Side (RHS)**:
   - Multiply `(a x - 8)(b x + 3)` to get `a b x² + (3 a - 8 b) x - 24`.

2. **Equate Coefficients**:
   - Set the expanded RHS equal to the LHS `10 x² - x - 24` and match coefficients of corresponding powers of `x`:
     - `10 = a b`,
     - `-1 = 3 a - 8 b`,
     - `-24 = -24` (trivially satisfied).

3. **Solve the System of Equations**:
   - From `10 = a b`, express `a = 10 / b` and substitute into `-1 = 3 a - 8 b` to get a quadratic in `b`:
     - `8 b² - b - 30 = 0`.
   - Solve for `b`:
     - `b = 2` or `b = -15 / 8`.
   - Find corresponding `a` values:
     - If `b = 2`, then `a = 5`.
     - If `b = -15 / 8`, then `a = -16 / 3`.

4. **Verify the Solution**:
   - Check that `a = 5`, `b = 2` satisfies the original identity:
     - `10 x² - x - 24 = (5 x - 8)(2 x + 3)`.

5. **Compute `a * b + b`**:
   - For `a = 5`, `b = 2`:
     - `a * b + b = 5 * 2 + 2 = 12`.
