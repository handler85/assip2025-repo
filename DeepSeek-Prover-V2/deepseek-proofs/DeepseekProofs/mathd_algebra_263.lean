/- ### Detailed Proof

**Problem:** Find \( y \) such that \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\) and show that \( y = 10 \).

**Assumptions:**
1. \( 19 + 3y \geq 0 \) (since the square root is real).
2. \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\).

**Approach:**
1. Square both sides of the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\) to eliminate the square root.
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( y \).
3. Verify that the solution satisfies the original equation and the domain condition.

**Detailed Solution:**

1. Start with the equation:
   \[
   \sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7.
   \]
2. Square both sides:
   \[
   19 + 3y = 49.
   \]
3. Subtract 19 from both sides:
   \[
   3y = 30.
   \]
4. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   y = 10.
   \]
5. Verification:
   - Substitute \( y = 10 \) back into the original equation:
     \[
     \sqrt{19 + 3 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{19 + 30} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
     \]
   - The solution is correct, and the domain condition \( 19 + 3y \geq 0 \) is satisfied since \( 19 + 3 \cdot 10 = 49 \geq 0 \).

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square root:
   \[
   \sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7 \implies 19 + 3y = 49.
   \]
2. **Solve for \( y \)**:
   \[
   19 + 3y = 49 \implies 3y = 30 \implies y = 10.
   \]
3. **Verify the solution** by substituting \( y = 10 \) back into the original equation to ensure it holds.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements
