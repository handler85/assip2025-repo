/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the sum of the first 12 positive integers and then find its remainder when divided by 4.

The sum of the first `n` positive integers is given by the formula:
\[ S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

For `n = 12`:
\[ S = \frac{12 \times 13}{2} = 6 \times 13 = 78 \]

Now, we need to find `78 mod 4`.

We can perform the division:
\[ 78 \div 4 = 19 \text{ with a remainder of } 2 \]

Alternatively, we can use the property that:
\[ a \mod m = (a \mod m) \mod m \]

But in this case, it's simpler to directly compute:
\[ 78 \mod 4 = (4 \times 19 + 2) \mod 4 = 2 \mod 4 = 2 \]

Thus, the remainder is `2`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Calculate the sum of the first 12 positive integers**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of the first `n` positive integers: `S = n(n + 1)/2`.
   - For `n = 12`, `S = 12 * 13 / 2 = 78`.

2. **Find the remainder of 78 when divided by 4**:
   - Perform the division `78 / 4 = 19` with a remainder of `2`.
   - Alternatively, `78 mod 4 = (4 * 19 + 2) mod 4 = 2 mod 4 = 2`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The remainder is `2`.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4

  have h_mod : 78 % 4 = 2 := by sorry
  have h_final : (∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 12, k) % 4 = 2 := by sorry
