/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given:
1. \( x \) is a positive real number (\( x > 0 \)) and \( x \geq 0 \).
2. The quadratic equation \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \).
3. \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \), where \( a, b, c \) are positive integers (\( a, b, c > 0 \)) and \( c = 2 \).
4. We need to prove that \( a + b + c = 26 \).

#### Step 1: Solve the Quadratic Equation
The quadratic equation is \( 2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0 \).

First, find the discriminant:
\[ \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-9) = 16 + 72 = 88. \]

The roots are:
\[ x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{88}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{22}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2}. \]

But \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \), and \( c = 2 \), so:
\[ x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2}. \]

This means:
\[ \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2}. \]

Thus:
\[ 2 \pm \sqrt{22} = a + \sqrt{b}. \]

But \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers, and \( \sqrt{22} \approx 4.69 \), so:
\[ 2 - \sqrt{22} \approx 2 - 4.69 = -2.69 < 0, \]
which is impossible since \( a + \sqrt{b} > 0 \).

Therefore, the only possibility is:
\[ 2 + \sqrt{22} = a + \sqrt{b}. \]

This gives:
\[ a = 2, \quad \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{22}, \quad b = 22. \]

But \( \sqrt{22} \) is not an integer, so this is a contradiction.

#### Step 2: Re-examining the Problem
The contradiction arises because we assumed that \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \), but \( x \) is actually \( \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \). 

But \( \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \) is not of the form \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \) with \( a, b \) integers, because \( \sqrt{22} \) is irrational.

This means that the original assumption that \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \) is incorrect, and the problem statement is inconsistent.

But wait, the problem statement says that \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \), and \( c = 2 \). So \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \).

But \( x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \), so \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \), which implies \( a + \sqrt{b} = 2 \pm \sqrt{22} \).

But \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers, and \( \sqrt{22} \) is irrational, so \( a + \sqrt{b} \) is irrational, but \( 2 \pm \sqrt{22} \) is irrational.

This is consistent, but we need to find \( a \) and \( b \).

From \( a + \sqrt{b} = 2 \pm \sqrt{22} \), we can write:
\[ a = 2, \quad \sqrt{b} = \pm \sqrt{22}, \]
but \( \sqrt{b} = \pm \sqrt{22} \) is impossible because \( \sqrt{b} \geq 0 \).

Alternatively, we can write:
\[ a = 0, \quad \sqrt{b} = 2 \pm \sqrt{22}, \]
but \( \sqrt{b} = 2 \pm \sqrt{22} \) is impossible because \( \sqrt{b} \geq 0 \) and \( 2 - \sqrt{22} < 0 \).

This suggests that the problem statement is incorrect, or that \( x \) is not of the form \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \).

But the problem statement is:
\[ x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2}, \]
and we are to find \( a, b \) such that \( x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \).

This is impossible because \( \sqrt{b} \) must be a non-negative real number, but \( \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \) is not expressible as \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \) with \( a, b \) integers and \( b \geq 0 \).

#### Step 3: Conclusion
The problem statement is inconsistent. There are no positive integers \( a, b, c \) such that \( c = 2 \) and \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \), where \( x \) is a solution to \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \).

However, if we ignore the condition \( c = 2 \), we can find \( a, b \) such that \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \).

But since \( x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \), we can write:
\[ a + \sqrt{b} = 2 \pm \sqrt{22}. \]

This is impossible because \( \sqrt{b} \) must be a non-negative real number, and \( 2 - \sqrt{22} < 0 \).

Thus, the problem is unsolvable as stated.

But if we assume that \( c = 2 \) is a typo and \( c = 1 \), then:
\[ x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{1} = a + \sqrt{b}. \]

But \( x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \), so:
\[ a + \sqrt{b} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2}. \]

This is impossible because \( \sqrt{b} \) must be a non-negative real number, and \( \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \) is not a non-negative real number.

Thus, the problem is still unsolvable.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan
1. Solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \) to find the roots \( x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \).
2. Assume \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) with \( c = 2 \), so \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \).
3. Equate \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \), so \( a + \sqrt{b} = 2 \pm \sqrt{22} \).
4. Since \( \sqrt{b} \geq 0 \), \( 2 - \sqrt{22} < 0 \), the right side is negative, but \( a + \sqrt{b} \geq 0 \). This is a contradiction.
5. Conclude that no such \( a, b, c \) exist.

```lean4
theorem mathd_algebra_320 (x : ℝ) (a b c : ℕ) (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c ∧ 0 ≤ x)
    (h₁ : 2 * x ^ 2 = 4 * x + 9) (h₂ : x = (a + Real.sqrt b) / c) (h₃ : c = 2) : a + b + c = 26 := by
  have h₄ : False := by sorry
  have h₅ : a + b + c = 26 := by sorry
  exact h₅
```

### Explanation
1. `h₄ : False` is derived from the contradiction in the problem statement. The contradiction arises because we cannot have \( a + \sqrt{b} = 2 \pm \sqrt{22} \) with \( \sqrt{b} \geq 0 \) and \( 2 - \sqrt{22} < 0 \).
2. `h₅ : a + b + c = 26` is derived from the contradiction `False` (which is impossible), so we can prove any statement, including `a + b + c = 26`.
3. The final result is `a + b + c = 26`.
