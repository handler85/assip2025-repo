### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given three linear equations in seven real variables \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g\):
1. \(a + 4b + 9c + 16d + 25e + 36f + 49g = 1\)
2. \(4a + 9b + 16c + 25d + 36e + 49f + 64g = 12\)
3. \(9a + 16b + 25c + 36d + 49e + 64f + 81g = 123\)

We need to find the value of:
\[ 16a + 25b + 36c + 49d + 64e + 81f + 100g \]

#### Step 1: Find a Pattern or Relationship

First, observe that the coefficients of the variables in each equation are perfect squares:
- \(1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49\) are \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \dots, 7^2\)
- The right-hand sides are \(1, 12, 123\), which are \(1^3, 2^3, 3^3\)

This suggests that the variables might be related to powers of consecutive integers.

#### Step 2: Assume a General Form

Let’s assume that each variable is a polynomial in \(n\) of degree \(2\) and the right-hand side is a polynomial in \(n\) of degree \(3\).

Given the first equation:
\[ a + 4b + 9c + 16d + 25e + 36f + 49g = 1 \]

We can write:
\[ a = 1 - 4b - 9c - 16d - 25e - 36f - 49g \]

But this seems complicated. Instead, let’s consider the second equation:
\[ 4a + 9b + 16c + 25d + 36e + 49f + 64g = 12 \]

We can write:
\[ 4a = 12 - 9b - 16c - 25d - 36e - 49f - 64g \]
\[ a = 3 - \frac{9}{4}b - 4c - \frac{25}{4}d - 9e - \frac{49}{4}f - 16g \]

This is still complicated.

#### Step 3: Find a Simpler Pattern

Let’s consider the differences between consecutive equations.

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (4a - a) + (9b - 4b) + (16c - 9c) + \dots + (64g - 49g) = 12 - 1 \]
\[ 3a + 5b + 7c + 9d + 11e + 13f + 15g = 11 \]

Similarly, subtract the second equation from the third:
\[ (9a - 4a) + (16b - 9b) + \dots + (81g - 64g) = 123 - 12 \]
\[ 5a + 7b + 9c + 11d + 13e + 15f + 17g = 111 \]

Now, we have two new equations:
1. \( 3a + 5b + 7c + 9d + 11e + 13f + 15g = 11 \)
2. \( 5a + 7b + 9c + 11d + 13e + 15f + 17g = 111 \)

#### Step 4: Solve the New System

Subtract the first new equation from the second:
\[ (5a - 3a) + (7b - 5b) + \dots + (17g - 15g) = 111 - 11 \]
\[ 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 2g = 100 \]
\[ a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 50 \]

This is a simpler equation.

#### Step 5: Find the Original Expression

We need to find:
\[ 16a + 25b + 36c + 49d + 64e + 81f + 100g \]

Notice that:
\[ 16a + 25b + 36c + 49d + 64e + 81f + 100g = 16a + 25b + 36c + 49d + 64e + 81f + 100g \]

This seems circular, but we can use the earlier results to find the value.

#### Step 6: Use the Original Equations to Find the Value

From the first original equation:
\[ a + 4b + 9c + 16d + 25e + 36f + 49g = 1 \]

We can write:
\[ a = 1 - 4b - 9c - 16d - 25e - 36f - 49g \]

Similarly, from the second original equation:
\[ 4a + 9b + 16c + 25d + 36e + 49f + 64g = 12 \]

We can write:
\[ 4a = 12 - 9b - 16c - 25d - 36e - 49f - 64g \]
\[ a = 3 - \frac{9}{4}b - 4c - \frac{25}{4}d - 9e - \frac{49}{4}f - 16g \]

This seems too complicated.

#### Step 7: Use the New Equations to Find the Value

From the new equations:
1. \( 3a + 5b + 7c + 9d + 11e + 13f + 15g = 11 \)
2. \( 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 2g = 100 \)

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ 2(a + b + c + d + e + f + g) = 100 \]
\[ a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 50 \]

This is consistent with our earlier result.

Now, we can find \( 16a + 25b + 36c + 49d + 64e + 81f + 100g \) by expressing everything in terms of the variables in the first equation.

However, this seems too involved.

#### Step 8: Use the Given Values to Find the Final Expression

\[ a + 4b + 9c + 16d + 25e + 36f + 49g = 1 \]
