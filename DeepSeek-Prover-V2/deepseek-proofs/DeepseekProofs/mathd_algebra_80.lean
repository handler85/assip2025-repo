/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given:
1. \( x \neq -1 \)
2. \( \frac{x - 9}{x + 1} = 2 \)

We need to prove that \( x = -11 \).

#### Step 1: Cross-Multiply to Eliminate the Denominator
The equation \( \frac{x - 9}{x + 1} = 2 \) can be rewritten by multiplying both sides by \( x + 1 \), provided \( x + 1 \neq 0 \). Since \( x \neq -1 \), \( x + 1 \neq 0 \), and we can safely cross-multiply:
\[ x - 9 = 2(x + 1) \]

#### Step 2: Expand and Simplify the Equation
Expand the right-hand side:
\[ x - 9 = 2x + 2 \]

Move all terms to one side to group like terms:
\[ x - 9 - 2x - 2 = 0 \]
\[ -x - 11 = 0 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Add \( 11 \) to both sides:
\[ -x = 11 \]

Multiply both sides by \( -1 \):
\[ x = -11 \]

This completes the proof.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Cross-Multiply**: Multiply both sides of the equation by \( x + 1 \) to eliminate the denominator, assuming \( x \neq -1 \).
2. **Expand and Simplify**: Expand the right-hand side and collect like terms to form a linear equation.
3. **Solve for \( x \)**: Isolate \( x \) to find its value, which is \( -11 \).

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_algebra_80 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x ≠ -1) (h₁ : (x - 9) / (x + 1) = 2) : x = -11 := by
  have h₂ : x - 9 = 2 * (x + 1) := by sorry
  have h₃ : x = -11 := by sorry
  sorry
```

### Explanation of `have` Statements:
1. `h₂`: Cross-multiplied the original equation to eliminate the denominator.
2. `h₃`: Simplified `h₂` to solve for `x` and obtained `x = -11`.
