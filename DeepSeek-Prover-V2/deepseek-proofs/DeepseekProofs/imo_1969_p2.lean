/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's carefully restate the problem in a more familiar form. We have:
1. A real number `k > 0` (but since `k` is a natural number, `k ≥ 1`).
2. A sequence of real numbers `a : ℕ → ℝ`.
3. A function `y : ℝ → ℝ` defined by `y(x) = ∑_{i=0}^{k-1} cos(a_i + x) / 2^i`.
4. Two real numbers `m` and `n` such that `y(m) = 0` and `y(n) = 0`.
5. We need to prove that `m - n = t * π` for some integer `t`.

#### Observations:
1. The sum `y(x)` is a finite sum of cosine terms with amplitudes `1/2^i` and phase shifts `a_i + x`.
2. The condition `y(m) = 0` and `y(n) = 0` is a system of equations in `x`.
3. The goal is to find a relationship between `m` and `n` that is a multiple of `π`.

#### Key Idea:
The cosine function `cos(θ)` is periodic with period `2π`, i.e., `cos(θ + 2π) = cos(θ)`. This suggests that if `θ` is a solution to `cos(θ) = c`, then `θ + 2π` is also a solution. 

In our case, we have `cos(a_i + m) / 2^i = 0` for each `i`, which implies `cos(a_i + m) = 0` (since `2^i ≠ 0`). Similarly, `cos(a_i + n) = 0` for each `i`.

But `cos(a_i + m) = 0` is equivalent to `a_i + m = π/2 + k_i π` for some integer `k_i`. Similarly, `a_i + n = π/2 + l_i π` for some integer `l_i`.

Subtracting these two equations gives:
`(a_i + m) - (a_i + n) = (π/2 + k_i π) - (π/2 + l_i π) = (k_i - l_i) π`.

This simplifies to `m - n = (k_i - l_i) π`, which is exactly the form we need, with `t = k_i - l_i` being an integer.

#### Verification:
1. The cosine function is periodic with period `2π`, so `cos(θ) = 0` implies `θ = π/2 + k π` for some integer `k`.
2. The difference `m - n` is a linear combination of these periods, hence is a multiple of `π`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Hypotheses**:
   - We have a finite sum of cosine terms with phase shifts `a_i + x` and amplitudes `1/2^i`.
   - The sum is zero at `x = m` and `x = n`.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The cosine function is zero at `π/2 + k π` for integer `k`.
   - The sum being zero implies that each cosine term in the sum is zero.

3. **Derive the Difference**:
   - For each `i`, `cos(a_i + m) = 0` and `cos(a_i + n) = 0`.
   - This gives `a_i + m = π/2 + k_i π` and `a_i + n = π/2 + l_i π` for integers `k_i, l_i`.
   - Subtract the two equations to get `m - n = (k_i - l_i) π`, which is the desired form.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The difference `m - n` is a multiple of `π` because it is a linear combination of the periods of the cosine functions.
