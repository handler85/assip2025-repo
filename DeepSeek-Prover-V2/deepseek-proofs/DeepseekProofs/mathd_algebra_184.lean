/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers:
1. \(6, a, b\)
2. \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\)

We need to solve for \(a\) and show that \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Sequences
A geometric sequence has a common ratio. For the first sequence \(6, a, b\):
- The common ratio is \(r_1 = \frac{a}{6}\).
- The third term is \(b = 6 \cdot r_1^2 = 6 \cdot \left(\frac{a}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{6}\).

For the second sequence \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\):
- The common ratio is \(r_2 = \frac{a}{\frac{1}{b}} = a \cdot b\) (assuming \(b \neq 0\), which is true since \(b > 0\)).
- The third term is \(54 = \frac{1}{b} \cdot r_2^2 = \frac{1}{b} \cdot (a \cdot b)^2 = a^2 \cdot b\).

But we can also directly use the property of geometric sequences:
1. For \(6, a, b\): \(a^2 = 6 \cdot b\) (given).
2. For \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\): \(a^2 = 54 / b\) (given).

#### Step 2: Solve the System of Equations
We have:
1. \(a^2 = 6 \cdot b\) (1)
2. \(a^2 = 54 / b\) (2)

From (1) and (2), we get:
\[6 \cdot b = \frac{54}{b}\]
Multiply both sides by \(b\):
\[6 \cdot b^2 = 54\]
Divide both sides by 6:
\[b^2 = 9\]
Take square roots:
\[b = 3\] (since \(b > 0\))

Substitute \(b = 3\) into (1):
\[a^2 = 6 \cdot 3 = 18\]
Thus:
\[a = \sqrt{18} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 2} = 3 \sqrt{2}\]

#### Step 3: Verification
We can verify that \(a = 3 \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 3\) satisfy both original equations:
1. \(a^2 = 18 = 6 \cdot 3 = 6 \cdot b\)
2. \(a^2 = 18 = \frac{54}{3} = \frac{54}{b}\)

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Derive the equations from the geometric sequences**:
   - From \(6, a, b\): \(a^2 = 6b\) (1)
   - From \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\): \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\) (2)

2. **Set the two expressions for \(a^2\) equal to each other**:
   - \(6b = \frac{54}{b}\)

3. **Solve for \(b\)**:
   - Multiply both sides by \(b\): \(6b^2 = 54\)
   - Divide by 6: \(b^2 = 9\)
   - Take square roots: \(b = 3\) (since \(b > 0\))

4. **Substitute \(b = 3\) back into (1) to find \(a\)**:
   - \(a^2 = 6 \cdot 3 = 18\)
   - \(a = \sqrt{18} = 3 \sqrt{2}\)

5. **Verify the solution**:
   - Check that \(a = 3 \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 3\) satisfy both original equations.
