### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
- We are given a natural number `n ≥ 2` such that:
  1. `n` is a perfect cube, i.e., there exists an integer `x` such that `x³ = n`.
  2. `n` is a perfect fourth power, i.e., there exists an integer `t` such that `t⁴ = n`.
- We need to prove that `n ≥ 4096`.

#### Key Observations:
1. The smallest perfect cube is `1³ = 1`, but `n ≥ 2` is given, so we can ignore `1`.
2. The smallest perfect fourth power is `1⁴ = 1`, but again, `n ≥ 2` is given, so we can ignore `1`.
3. The next perfect cube after `1` is `2³ = 8`, and the next perfect fourth power is `2⁴ = 16`. But `8 ≠ 16`, so no match.
4. The next perfect cube is `3³ = 27`, and the next perfect fourth power is `2⁴ = 16` (no, `2⁴ = 16` is not a perfect fourth power) or `3⁴ = 81` (no, `27 ≠ 81`). Hmm, this is not working.
5. Wait, the problem is phrased as `n` is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, and we need to find the smallest such `n > 1`.
6. The smallest `n` that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is `n = 1`, but `n ≥ 2` is given. The next candidate is `n = 2`:
   - `2` is not a perfect cube (`1³ = 1`, `2³ = 8`).
   - `2` is not a perfect fourth power (`1⁴ = 1`, `2⁴ = 16`).
   Next is `n = 3`:
   - `3` is not a perfect cube (`1³ = 1`, `2³ = 8`).
   - `3` is not a perfect fourth power (`1⁴ = 1`, `2⁴ = 16`).
   Next is `n = 4`:
   - `4` is not a perfect cube (`1³ = 1`, `2³ = 8`).
   - `4` is not a perfect fourth power (`1⁴ = 1`, `2⁴ = 16`).
   Next is `n = 5`:
   - `5` is not a perfect cube (`1³ = 1`, `2³ = 8`).
   - `5` is not a perfect fourth power (`1⁴ = 1`, `2⁴ = 16`).
   Next is `n = 6`:
   - `6` is not a perfect cube (`1³ = 1`, `2³ = 8`).
   - `6` is not a perfect fourth power (`1⁴ = 1`, `2⁴ = 16`).
   Next is `n = 7`:
   - `7` is not a perfect cube (`1³ = 1`, `2³ = 8`).
   - `7` is not a perfect fourth power (`1⁴ = 1`, `2⁴ = 16`).
   Next is `n = 8`:
   - `8` is a perfect cube (`2³ = 8`).
   - `8` is not a perfect fourth power (`1⁴ = 1`, `2⁴ = 16`).
   Next is `n = 9`:
   - `9` is not a perfect cube (`1³ = 1`, `2³ = 8`).
   - `9` is not a perfect fourth power (`1⁴ = 1`, `2⁴ = 16`).
   Next is `n = 10`:
   - `10` is not a perfect cube (`1³ = 1`, `2³ = 8`).
   - `10` is not a perfect fourth power (`1⁴ = 1`, `2⁴ = 16`).
   ...
   It seems tedious to check all numbers, but we can find a pattern or use the fact that the least common multiple of the exponents in the prime factorization of `n` must be `4` (for `n` to be a perfect fourth power) and `3` (for `n` to be a perfect cube).

3. **Find the smallest `n` that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power**:
   - We find that `n = 8` is the smallest such `n`.
