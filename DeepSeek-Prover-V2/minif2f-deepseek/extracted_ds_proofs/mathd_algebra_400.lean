### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We have the equation:
\[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]

Simplify the left-hand side (LHS):
\[ 5 + 5 \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55 \]

But wait, the original LHS is \(5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10\). The multiplication is done before the addition, so:
\[ \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 5 \times 10 = 50 \]
\[ 5 + 50 = 55 \]

So the LHS is \(55\).

The right-hand side (RHS) is:
\[ \frac{110}{100} \times x = \frac{11}{10} \times x \]

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ 55 = \frac{11}{10} \times x \]

Multiply both sides by \(10\):
\[ 550 = 11 \times x \]

Divide both sides by \(11\):
\[ x = \frac{550}{11} = 50 \]

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the LHS**:
   - Compute \(500 / 100 \times 10 = 50\).
   - Add \(5\) to get \(55\).

2. **Simplify the RHS**:
   - \(110 / 100 = 11 / 10\).
   - The equation becomes \(55 = (11 / 10) \times x\).

3. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   - Multiply both sides by \(10\) to get \(550 = 11 \times x\).
   - Divide both sides by \(11\) to get \(x = 50\).
