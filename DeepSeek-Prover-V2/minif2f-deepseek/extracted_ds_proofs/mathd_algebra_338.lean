### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have a system of three linear equations in three real variables \(a, b, c\):
1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)   (1)
2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)   (2)
3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)   (3)

We need to find the product \(abc\).

**Approach:**
To find \(abc\), we can first solve for \(a, b, c\) using the given equations. We can do this by subtracting the equations to eliminate variables and then back-substitute to find the values of the variables.

**Step 1: Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):**
\[
(a + 3b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 9 - (-3) \\
a + 3b + c - 3a - b - c = 12 \\
-2a + 2b = 12 \\
-a + b = 6 \quad \text{(Divide by 2)} \\
b = a + 6 \quad \text{(4)}
\]

**Step 2: Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3):**
\[
(a + b + 3c) - (3a + b + c) = 19 - (-3) \\
a + b + 3c - 3a - b - c = 22 \\
-2a + 2c = 22 \\
-a + c = 11 \quad \text{(Divide by 2)} \\
c = a + 11 \quad \text{(5)}
\]

**Step 3: Substitute \(b = a + 6\) and \(c = a + 11\) into Equation (1):**
\[
3a + b + c = -3 \\
3a + (a + 6) + (a + 11) = -3 \\
3a + a + a + 6 + 11 = -3 \\
5a + 17 = -3 \\
5a = -20 \\
a = -4
\]

**Step 4: Find \(b\) and \(c\):**
Using \(b = a + 6\) and \(a = -4\):
\[
b = -4 + 6 = 2
\]
Using \(c = a + 11\) and \(a = -4\):
\[
c = -4 + 11 = 7
\]

**Verification:**
Check all three original equations with \(a = -4\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 7\):
1. \(3a + b + c = 3(-4) + 2 + 7 = -12 + 2 + 7 = -3\) ✔️
2. \(a + 3b + c = -4 + 3(2) + 7 = -4 + 6 + 7 = 9\) ✔️
3. \(a + b + 3c = -4 + 2 + 3(7) = -4 + 2 + 21 = 19\) ✔️

**Final Answer:**
\[
abc = (-4) \times 2 \times 7 = -56
\]

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2)** to eliminate \(a\) and \(c\), and solve for \(b\) in terms of \(a\):
   - \(b = a + 6\).

2. **Subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3)** to eliminate \(a\) and \(c\), and solve for \(c\) in terms of \(a\):
   - \(c = a + 11\).

3. **Substitute \(b = a + 6\) and \(c = a + 11\) into Equation (1)** to solve for \(a\):
   - \(a = -4\).

4. **Find \(b\) and \(c\) using \(a = -4\)**:
   - \(b = 2\),
   - \(c = 7\).

5. **Calculate \(abc\)**:
   - \(abc = (-4) \times 2 \times 7 = -56\).
