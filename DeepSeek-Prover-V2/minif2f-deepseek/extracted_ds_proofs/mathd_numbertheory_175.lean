/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem:** Find the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), i.e., \(2^{2010} \mod 10\).

**Approach:**
The units digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. We can find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\) by computing the powers of 2 modulo 10 until we observe a cycle.

**Step 1: Compute Powers of 2 Modulo 10**

Let's compute \(2^n \mod 10\) for increasing \(n\) until the cycle is detected:

- \(2^1 \mod 10 = 2\)
- \(2^2 \mod 10 = 4\)
- \(2^3 \mod 10 = 8\)
- \(2^4 \mod 10 = 16 \mod 10 = 6\)
- \(2^5 \mod 10 = 32 \mod 10 = 2\)
- \(2^6 \mod 10 = 64 \mod 10 = 4\)
- ...

We observe that the sequence of units digits cycles every 4 powers: \(2, 4, 8, 6\).

**Step 2: Find the Position in the Cycle**

We need to find \(2010 \mod 4\) because the cycle length is 4.

Compute \(2010 \div 4 = 502\) with a remainder of \(2010 - 4 \times 502 = 2010 - 2008 = 2\).

Thus, \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\).

**Step 3: Determine the Units Digit**

The units digit corresponds to the 2nd position in the cycle: \(2^2 \mod 10 = 4\).

Therefore, the units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is 4.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\).

2. **Find the Cycle Length:**
   - Compute powers of 2 modulo 10 until the cycle is detected.
   - The cycle length is 4: \(2, 4, 8, 6\).

3. **Determine the Position in the Cycle:**
   - Find \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\).

4. **Find the Units Digit:**
   - The 2nd position in the cycle is 4.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is 4.
