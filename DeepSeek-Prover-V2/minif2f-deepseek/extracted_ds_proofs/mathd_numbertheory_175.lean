### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), i.e., \(2^{2010} \mod 10\).

#### Step 1: Understand the Units Digit Pattern of Powers of 2
The units digit of powers of 2 cycles every 4 exponents:
- \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit 2)
- \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit 4)
- \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit 8)
- \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit 6)
- \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit 2)
- and so on.

This cycle repeats every 4 powers.

#### Step 2: Find the Position in the Cycle
We need to find \(2010 \mod 4\) to determine the position in the cycle:
\[ 2010 \div 4 = 502 \text{ with a remainder of } 2 \]
Thus, \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\).

This means that \(2^{2010}\) has the same units digit as \(2^2\), which is 4.

#### Step 3: Formal Proof
1. The units digit of \(2^n\) cycles every 4 powers:
   - \(2^1 \mod 10 = 2\)
   - \(2^2 \mod 10 = 4\)
   - \(2^3 \mod 10 = 8\)
   - \(2^4 \mod 10 = 6\)
   - and repeats every 4 steps.
2. We need to find \(2010 \mod 4\):
   - \(2010 = 4 \times 502 + 2\)
   - Thus, \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\).
3. Therefore, \(2^{2010} \mod 10 = 2^{2} \mod 10 = 4\).

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Cycle**:
   - The units digit of powers of 2 cycles every 4 steps: 2, 4, 8, 6.

2. **Find the Position in the Cycle**:
   - Compute \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\).

3. **Determine the Units Digit**:
   - The units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is the same as \(2^2\), which is 4.
