/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to solve the congruence `3 * n ≡ 2 mod 11` for `n` modulo 11. 

#### Step 1: Understand the Congruence
The congruence `3 * n ≡ 2 mod 11` means that `11` divides `3 * n - 2`, or equivalently, `3 * n - 2` is a multiple of `11`. 

#### Step 2: Find the Inverse of `3` Modulo `11`
We need to find an integer `k` such that `3 * k ≡ 1 mod 11`. 

Testing small integers:
- `3 * 1 = 3 ≡ 3 mod 11`
- `3 * 2 = 6 ≡ 6 mod 11`
- `3 * 3 = 9 ≡ 9 mod 11`
- `3 * 4 = 12 ≡ 1 mod 11`

Thus, `k = 4` is the inverse of `3` modulo `11`.

#### Step 3: Multiply Both Sides by the Inverse
Multiply both sides of the original congruence by `4`:
`4 * (3 * n) ≡ 4 * 2 mod 11`
`(4 * 3) * n ≡ 8 mod 11`
`12 * n ≡ 8 mod 11`
But `12 ≡ 1 mod 11`, so:
`1 * n ≡ 8 mod 11`
`n ≡ 8 mod 11`

Thus, `n % 11 = 8`.

#### Step 4: Verification
Check that `3 * 8 = 24` and `24 % 11 = 2` (since `24 = 2 * 11 + 2`). 

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Congruence**:
   - The problem is to find `n` such that `3 * n ≡ 2 mod 11`.

2. **Find the Inverse of `3` Modulo `11`**:
   - The inverse of `3` modulo `11` is `4` because `3 * 4 ≡ 1 mod 11`.

3. **Multiply Both Sides by the Inverse**:
   - Multiply both sides of the congruence by `4` to get `n ≡ 8 mod 11`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution is `n ≡ 8 mod 11`, i.e., `n % 11 = 8`.

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_247 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : 3 * n % 11 = 2) : n % 11 = 8 := by
  have h₁ : n % 11 = 8 := by
    sorry
  sorry
```

This sketch uses a `have` statement to directly state the goal `n % 11 = 8` and marks it as `sorry`ed. The actual proof would fill in the `sorry` by following the steps outlined in the abstract plan.
