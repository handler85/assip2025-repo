### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given:
1. \( a, b, c > 0 \),
2. \( 9b = 20c \),
3. \( 7a = 4b \).

We need to prove that \( 63a = 80c \).

#### Step 1: Solve for \( b \) in terms of \( c \)
From \( 9b = 20c \), we get:
\[ b = \frac{20}{9}c. \]

#### Step 2: Solve for \( a \) in terms of \( b \)
From \( 7a = 4b \), we get:
\[ a = \frac{4}{7}b. \]

#### Step 3: Substitute \( b \) in terms of \( c \) into \( a \)
Substitute \( b = \frac{20}{9}c \) into \( a = \frac{4}{7}b \):
\[ a = \frac{4}{7} \cdot \frac{20}{9}c = \frac{80}{63}c. \]

#### Step 4: Multiply by 63 to get \( 63a = 80c \)
Multiply both sides by 63:
\[ 63a = 63 \cdot \frac{80}{63}c = 80c. \]

This completes the proof.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Express \( b \) in terms of \( c \)**:
   - From \( 9b = 20c \), solve for \( b \): \( b = \frac{20}{9}c \).

2. **Express \( a \) in terms of \( b \)**:
   - From \( 7a = 4b \), solve for \( a \): \( a = \frac{4}{7}b \).

3. **Substitute \( b \) into \( a \)**:
   - Substitute \( b = \frac{20}{9}c \) into \( a = \frac{4}{7}b \):
     \[ a = \frac{4}{7} \cdot \frac{20}{9}c = \frac{80}{63}c. \]

4. **Multiply by 63 to get the final result**:
   - Multiply both sides by 63:
     \[ 63a = 63 \cdot \frac{80}{63}c = 80c. \]
