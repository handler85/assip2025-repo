### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall that `σ : Equiv ℝ ℝ` is an equivalence (i.e., a bijection) from `ℝ` to `ℝ`. The condition `σ.1 2 = σ.2 2` is given, where `σ.1` is the forward map and `σ.2` is the inverse map. 

However, Lean's `Equiv` is a structure with two maps `toFun` and `invFun` and proofs that they are inverses of each other. The notation `σ.1` is shorthand for `σ.toFun` and `σ.2` is shorthand for `σ.invFun`. 

But in Lean, `Equiv` is a structure with `toFun` and `invFun` and proofs that `toFun ∘ invFun = id` and `invFun ∘ toFun = id`. 

Given that, the condition `σ.1 2 = σ.2 2` is `σ.toFun 2 = σ.invFun 2`. 

We need to prove that `σ.toFun (σ.toFun 2) = 2`. 

But since `σ.toFun` is a bijection, we can use its properties. 

First, note that `σ.toFun (σ.invFun 2) = 2` because `σ.toFun` and `σ.invFun` are inverses. 

But we are given `σ.toFun 2 = σ.invFun 2`, so we can substitute:
`σ.toFun (σ.toFun 2) = σ.toFun (σ.invFun 2) = 2`. 

This is the desired result. 

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Given Condition**:
   - `σ.toFun 2 = σ.invFun 2` is given.
   - `σ.toFun` and `σ.invFun` are inverses of each other, i.e., `σ.toFun ∘ σ.invFun = id` and `σ.invFun ∘ σ.toFun = id`.

2. **Use the Inverse Property**:
   - Since `σ.toFun` and `σ.invFun` are inverses, we have `σ.toFun (σ.invFun 2) = 2`.

3. **Substitute the Given Condition**:
   - The given condition is `σ.toFun 2 = σ.invFun 2`, so we can rewrite `σ.toFun (σ.invFun 2)` as `σ.toFun (σ.toFun 2)`.

4. **Conclude the Proof**:
   - Therefore, `σ.toFun (σ.toFun 2) = 2`, which is the desired result.
