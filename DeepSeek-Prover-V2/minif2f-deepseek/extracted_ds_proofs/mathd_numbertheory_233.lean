### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem. We are working in the ring `ZMod (11²)`, i.e., modulo `121 = 11²`. The inverse of `24` in this ring is `116`, i.e., `24 * 116 ≡ 1 mod 121`. 

To prove this, we need to verify that `24 * 116 ≡ 1 mod 121`. 

#### Calculation:
1. Compute `24 * 116 = 24 * (100 + 10 + 6) = 2400 + 240 + 144 = 2784`.
2. Compute `2784 mod 121`:
   - `121 * 23 = 2783`
   - `2784 - 2783 = 1`
   - So, `2784 ≡ 1 mod 121`.

Thus, `24 * 116 ≡ 1 mod 121`, and `116` is the inverse of `24` modulo `121`.

#### Verification in Lean:
Lean's `ZMod (11^2)` is `ZMod 121`, and `24⁻¹` is the multiplicative inverse of `24` in this ring. The above calculation shows that `24 * 116 ≡ 1 mod 121`, so `116` is indeed the inverse of `24` in `ZMod 121`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We need to find the inverse of `24` modulo `121` (`11²`).
   - The inverse is `116`, i.e., `24 * 116 ≡ 1 mod 121`.

2. **Verify the Inverse**:
   - Compute `24 * 116 = 2784`.
   - Compute `2784 mod 121 = 1` because `121 * 23 = 2783` and `2784 - 2783 = 1`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - `116` is the inverse of `24` modulo `121`.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_233
  (b :  ZMod (11^2))
  (h₀ : b = 24⁻¹) :
  b = 116 := by
  have h₁ : (24 : ZMod (11^2)) * 116 = 1 := by sorry
  have h₂ : b = 116 := by sorry
  exact h₂
```

### Explanation:
1. `h₁`: This is the key calculation that `24 * 116 = 1` in `ZMod 121`. The `sorry` here will be replaced by the actual calculation in Lean.
2. `h₂`: Since `b = 24⁻¹` by hypothesis and `24⁻¹ = 116` in `ZMod 121` (because `24 * 116 = 1`), we can conclude `b = 116`. The `sorry` here will be replaced by the actual proof in Lean.
