### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to prove the inequality:
\[ \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b} \]
under the conditions \(a > 0\), \(b > 0\), and \(b \leq a\).

#### Key Observations:
1. The term \(\frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab}\) is the difference between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. The term \(\frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}\) is a measure of how "far" \(a\) is from \(b\) relative to \(b\).
3. The condition \(b \leq a\) is crucial because if \(a < b\), the right-hand side becomes negative, while the left-hand side is positive, making the inequality trivially true. However, in the problem, \(a \geq b\) is given, so we need to handle this case carefully.

#### Strategy:
1. First, we can assume \(a \geq b > 0\) because \(b \leq a\) and \(a, b > 0\) are given.
2. We can rewrite the inequality to eliminate denominators and simplify it.
3. We can use the AM-GM inequality to bound \(\frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab}\).
4. Alternatively, we can directly compare the two sides by cross-multiplying and simplifying.

#### Detailed Proof:

We start with the given inequality:
\[ \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b} \]

First, multiply both sides by \(8b\) (since \(b > 0\), the direction of the inequality is preserved):
\[ 4b(a + b) - 8b \sqrt{ab} \leq (a - b)^2 \]

Expand the left-hand side:
\[ 4ab + 4b^2 - 8b \sqrt{ab} \leq a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \]

Bring all terms to one side:
\[ 4ab + 4b^2 - 8b \sqrt{ab} - a^2 + 2ab - b^2 \leq 0 \]
\[ -a^2 + 6ab + 3b^2 - 8b \sqrt{ab} \leq 0 \]
\[ a^2 - 6ab - 3b^2 + 8b \sqrt{ab} \geq 0 \]

This seems complicated, so perhaps a better approach is to use the substitution \(k = \frac{a}{b} \geq 1\) (since \(a \geq b > 0\)). Then \(a = k b\), and the inequality becomes:
\[ \frac{k b + b}{2} - \sqrt{k b \cdot b} \leq \frac{(k b - b)^2}{8 b} \]
\[ \frac{(k + 1) b}{2} - b \sqrt{k} \leq \frac{(k - 1)^2 b^2}{8 b} \]
\[ \frac{(k + 1) b}{2} - b \sqrt{k} \leq \frac{(k - 1)^2 b}{8} \]
Since \(b > 0\), we can divide both sides by \(b\):
\[ \frac{k + 1}{2} - \sqrt{k} \leq \frac{(k - 1)^2}{8} \]

Now, we need to prove:
\[ \frac{k + 1}{2} - \sqrt{k} \leq \frac{(k - 1)^2}{8} \]
for \(k \geq 1\).

Multiply both sides by 8:
\[ 4(k + 1) - 8 \sqrt{k} \leq (k - 1)^2 \]
\[ 4k + 4 - 8 \sqrt{k} \leq k^2 - 2k + 1 \]
\[ 0 \leq k^2 - 6k + 4 + 8 \sqrt{k} \]

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a better approach. Let's instead consider the original inequality and use the fact that:
\[ \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b} \]
is equivalent to:
\[ 4b(a + b) - 8b \sqrt{ab} \leq (a - b)^2 \]
which is equivalent to:
\[ 4ab + 4b^2 - 8b \sqrt{ab} \leq a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \]
which is equivalent to:
\[ 0 \leq a^2 - 6ab + 3b^2 + 8b \sqrt{ab} \]

This seems more manageable. Let's try to prove:
\[ a^2 - 6ab + 3b^2 + 8b \sqrt{ab} \geq 0 \]
for \(a \geq b > 0\).

#### Proof of the Final Inequality:

We can write \(a = b + t\) where \(t \geq 0\) (since \(a \geq b\)). Then:
\[ a^2 - 6ab + 3b^2 + 8b \sqrt{ab} = (b + t)^2 - 6b(b + t) + 3b^2 + 8b \sqrt{b(b + t)} \]
\[ = b^2 + 2bt + t^2 - 6b^2 - 6bt + 3b^2 + 8b \sqrt{b(b + t)} \]
\[ = (b^2 - 6b^2 + 3b^2) + (2bt - 6bt) + t^2 + 8b \sqrt{b(b + t)} \]
\[ = -2b^2 - 4bt + t^2 + 8b \sqrt{b(b + t)} \]
