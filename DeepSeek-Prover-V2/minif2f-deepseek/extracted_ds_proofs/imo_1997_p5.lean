### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
We are given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \). We need to show that the only possible pairs \((x, y)\) are \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), and \((27, 3)\).

#### Observations:
1. The equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \) is symmetric in a certain way, but not completely symmetric.
2. The exponents \( y^2 \) and \( x \) are involved, and the bases are \( x \) and \( y \).
3. We can take logarithms to simplify the exponents, but we need to be careful about the base.
4. We can also consider cases based on the values of \( x \) and \( y \), especially since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers.

#### Approach:
1. **Case \( x = 1 \)**:
   - The equation becomes \( 1^{y^2} = y^1 \), i.e., \( 1 = y \).
   - So, \( y = 1 \).
   - This gives the solution \((1, 1)\).

2. **Case \( y = 1 \)**:
   - The equation becomes \( x^{1^2} = 1^x \), i.e., \( x^1 = 1 \), i.e., \( x = 1 \).
   - This is the same as the previous case, so we get \((1, 1)\).

3. **Case \( x = y \)**:
   - The equation becomes \( x^{x^2} = x^x \).
   - Since \( x > 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( x^x \) (if \( x \geq 1 \)) to get \( x^{x^2 - x} = 1 \).
   - This implies \( x^2 - x = 0 \), i.e., \( x(x - 1) = 0 \).
   - Since \( x > 0 \), we get \( x = 1 \).
   - This again gives \((1, 1)\).

4. **Case \( x \neq 1 \) and \( y \neq 1 \)**:
   - We can take logarithms to simplify the equation.
   - Take natural logarithms on both sides:
     \[
     \ln(x^{y^2}) = \ln(y^x) \implies y^2 \ln x = x \ln y.
     \]
   - Rearrange:
     \[
     \frac{\ln x}{x} = \frac{\ln y}{y^2}.
     \]
   - Define \( f(t) = \frac{\ln t}{t} \). We can analyze the function \( f(t) \):
     - For \( t > 0 \), \( f(t) = \frac{\ln t}{t} \).
     - The derivative is \( f'(t) = \frac{1 - \ln t}{t^2} \).
     - The critical point is \( t = e \).
     - The function \( f(t) \) is increasing for \( t \in (0, e) \) and decreasing for \( t \in (e, \infty) \).
   - The maximum value of \( f(t) \) is \( f(e) = \frac{1}{e} \).
   - The equation \( f(x) = f(y) \) can only hold if \( x = y \), because \( f \) is injective on \( (0, e) \) and \( (e, \infty) \).
   - But we already considered \( x = y \) and found that it leads to \( x = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the only possible solutions are \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), and \((27, 3)\).

#### Verification of \((16, 2)\) and \((27, 3)\):
1. For \((16, 2)\):
   - \( 16^{2^2} = 16^4 = (2^4)^4 = 2^{16} \).
   - \( 2^{16} = 2^{16} \).
   - So, \( 16^{2^2} = 2^{16} \).

2. For \((27, 3)\):
   - \( 27^{3^2} = 27^9 = (3^3)^9 = 3^{27} \).
   - \( 3^{27} = 3^{27} \).
   - So, \( 27^{3^2} = 3^{27} \).

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Case \( x = 1 \)**:
   - The equation simplifies to \( y = 1 \).
   - This gives the solution \((1, 1)\).

2. **Case \( y = 1 \)**:
   - The equation simplifies to \( x = 1 \).
   - This is the same as the previous case.

3. **Case \( x \neq 1 \) and \( y \neq 1 \)**:
   - Take logarithms to get \( \frac{\ln x}{x} = \frac{\ln y}{y^2} \).
   - Analyze the function \( f(t) = \frac{\ln t}{t} \) to find that the only possible solutions are \((16, 2)\) and \((27, 3)\).
