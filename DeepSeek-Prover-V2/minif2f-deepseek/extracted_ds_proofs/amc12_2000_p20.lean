### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given three positive real numbers \(x, y, z\) and three equations:
1. \(x + \frac{1}{y} = 4\),
2. \(y + \frac{1}{z} = 1\),
3. \(z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3}\).

We need to find the value of \(xyz\).

#### Step 1: Find expressions for reciprocals
From the first equation:
\[ x = 4 - \frac{1}{y} \]

From the second equation:
\[ y = 1 - \frac{1}{z} \]

From the third equation:
\[ z = \frac{7}{3} - \frac{1}{x} \]

#### Step 2: Substitute to find a relationship
Substitute \(y = 1 - \frac{1}{z}\) into \(x = 4 - \frac{1}{y}\):
\[ x = 4 - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{z}} = 4 - \frac{1}{\frac{z - 1}{z}} = 4 - \frac{z}{z - 1} \]

But from \(z = \frac{7}{3} - \frac{1}{x}\), we can also write:
\[ x = \frac{1}{\frac{7}{3} - z} \]

This seems complicated, so perhaps we can find a simpler relationship.

#### Step 3: Multiply the three equations
Multiply the three equations together:
\[ (x + \frac{1}{y})(y + \frac{1}{z})(z + \frac{1}{x}) = 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{7}{3} \]

But notice that:
\[ (x + \frac{1}{y})(y + \frac{1}{z})(z + \frac{1}{x}) = (xy + x \cdot \frac{1}{z} + \frac{1}{y} \cdot y + \frac{1}{y} \cdot \frac{1}{z})(z + \frac{1}{x}) \]

This seems too complicated. Instead, let's consider the substitution approach more carefully.

#### Step 4: Substitution approach
From the first equation:
\[ x = 4 - \frac{1}{y} \]

From the second equation:
\[ y = 1 - \frac{1}{z} \]

From the third equation:
\[ z = \frac{7}{3} - \frac{1}{x} \]

Now, substitute \(y = 1 - \frac{1}{z}\) into \(x = 4 - \frac{1}{y}\):
\[ x = 4 - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{z}} \]

Next, substitute \(x = 4 - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{z}}\) into \(z = \frac{7}{3} - \frac{1}{x}\):
\[ z = \frac{7}{3} - \frac{1}{4 - \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{z}}} \]

This seems too complicated, so perhaps we can find a simpler pattern.

#### Step 5: Find a pattern
Let's try to find a pattern by testing small positive integers for \(x, y, z\).

From the first equation:
\[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]

Possible values for \(x\) and \(y\):
- If \(x = 1\), then \(\frac{1}{y} = 3 \Rightarrow y = \frac{1}{3}\).
- If \(x = 2\), then \(\frac{1}{y} = 2 \Rightarrow y = \frac{1}{2}\).
- If \(x = 3\), then \(\frac{1}{y} = 1 \Rightarrow y = 1\).
- If \(x = 4\), then \(\frac{1}{y} = 0\), but \(y > 0\) is invalid.

Thus, possible \((x, y)\) pairs are \((1, \frac{1}{3}), (2, \frac{1}{2}), (3, 1)\).

Now, check the second equation:
\[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]

For each \((x, y)\) pair:
1. \((x, y) = (1, \frac{1}{3})\):
   \[ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{z} = \frac{2}{3} \Rightarrow z = \frac{3}{2} \]

2. \((x, y) = (2, \frac{1}{2})\):
   \[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow z = 2 \]

3. \((x, y) = (3, 1)\):
   \[ 1 + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{z} = 0 \]
   But \(z > 0\) is invalid.

Thus, the only valid solution is \((x, y, z) = (1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{3}{2})\).

But wait, we need to check the third equation:
\[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]

For \((x, y, z) = (1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{3}{2})\):
\[ \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{1} = \frac{3}{2} + 1 = \frac{5}{2} \neq \frac{7}{3} \]

This is incorrect. Let's try another \((x, y)\) pair.

#### Step 6: Try another \((x, y)\) pair
From the first equation:
\[ x = 4 - \frac{1}{y} \]

Let's try \(x = 2\):
\[ 2 = 4 - \frac{1}{y} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{y} = 2 \Rightarrow y = \frac{1}{2} \]

Now, check the second equation:
\[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow z = 2 \]

Now, check the third equation:
\[ z + \frac{1}{x} = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 = \frac{5}{2} \neq \frac{7}{3} \]

This is incorrect. Let's try \(x = 3\):
\[ 3 = 4 - \frac{1}{y} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{y} = 1 \Rightarrow y = 1 \]

Now, check the second equation:
\[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \Rightarrow 1 + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{z} = 0 \]
But \(z > 0\) is invalid.

Thus, the only valid solution is \((x, y, z) = (1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{3}{2})\), but it does not satisfy the third equation.

#### Step 7: Re-evaluate the approach
Given the complexity, perhaps the correct solution is \((x, y, z) = (1, \frac{1}{2}, 2)\).

Let's check:
1. \(x + \frac{1}{y} = 1 + \frac{1}{0.5} = 1 + 2 = 3 \neq 4\)

This is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct solution is \((x, y, z) = (1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{3}{2})\), but it does not satisfy the third equation.

#### Step 8: Correct solution
After testing several possibilities, the correct solution is \((x, y, z) = (1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{3}{2})\), but it does not satisfy the third equation.
