### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to prove that for any real number \( x > -1 \) and any natural number \( n > 0 \), the inequality \((1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n\) holds.

#### Key Observations:
1. The inequality resembles the Bernoulli inequality, but it is not directly applicable here because the exponent \( n \) is not a natural number in the usual Bernoulli inequality. However, we can use induction to prove it.
2. The case \( n = 1 \) is trivial: \((1 + 1 \cdot x) = 1 + x \leq (1 + x)^1 = 1 + x\) holds with equality.
3. For \( n \geq 2 \), we can use the binomial expansion of \((1 + x)^n\) and compare terms. However, this is complicated.
4. Alternatively, we can use the **weighted AM-GM inequality** or **Jensen's inequality** for the function \( f(y) = (1 + y)^n \), but this is overkill.
5. A simpler approach is to use **induction on \( n \)**.

#### Induction Proof:
**Base Case (\( n = 1 \))**:
The inequality becomes \((1 + 1 \cdot x) \leq (1 + x)^1\), i.e., \(1 + x \leq 1 + x\), which is trivially true.

**Inductive Step**:
Assume the inequality holds for some \( n = k \geq 1 \), i.e., \((1 + kx) \leq (1 + x)^k\). We need to prove it for \( n = k + 1 \), i.e., \((1 + (k + 1)x) \leq (1 + x)^{k + 1}\).

Starting with the LHS for \( n = k + 1 \):
\[
1 + (k + 1)x = (1 + kx) + x.
\]
By the inductive hypothesis, \((1 + kx) \leq (1 + x)^k\), so:
\[
1 + (k + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^k + x.
\]
We need to show that \((1 + x)^k + x \leq (1 + x)^{k + 1}\).

Notice that:
\[
(1 + x)^{k + 1} = (1 + x)^k (1 + x).
\]
Thus, the inequality becomes:
\[
(1 + x)^k + x \leq (1 + x)^k (1 + x).
\]
Since \( x > -1 \), \( 1 + x > 0 \), and we can divide both sides by \((1 + x)^k\) (a positive quantity):
\[
1 + \frac{x}{(1 + x)^k} \leq 1 + x.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x}{(1 + x)^k} \leq x.
\]
Since \( x > -1 \), \( 1 + x > 0 \), and \( x \leq x (1 + x)^k \) is equivalent to \( 1 \leq (1 + x)^k \), which is true because \( (1 + x) \geq 1 \) and \( k \geq 1 \).

However, this seems too involved. A simpler approach is to use the **weighted AM-GM inequality** or to directly compare the terms.

#### Simpler Approach:
We can use the **weighted AM-GM inequality** to prove the inequality.

Let \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = x \), and \( w_1 = n \), \( w_2 = 1 \). Then:
\[
\frac{n \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot x}{n + 1} \leq \left( n \cdot 1^n + 1 \cdot x^1 \right)^{\frac{1}{n + 1}}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n + x}{n + 1} \leq \left( n + x \right)^{\frac{1}{n + 1}}.
\]
This is not directly helpful, so we abandon this approach.

#### Final Approach:
Instead, we can use the **binomial expansion** of \((1 + x)^n\):
\[
(1 + x)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k.
\]
We need to show that:
\[
1 + n x \leq \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k.
\]
This is true because the LHS is \( 1 + n x \), and the RHS is at least \( 1 + n x + \binom{n}{2} x^2 \geq 1 + n x \).

But this is not rigorous. A better approach is to use the **fact that \((1 + x)^n \geq 1 + n x\) for \( x > -1 \) and \( n \geq 1 \)** by considering the **tangent line approximation** or by induction.

#### Induction Proof (Revisited):
We can also use induction to prove \((1 + x)^n \geq 1 + n x\) for \( x > -1 \) and \( n \geq 1 \).

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \))**:
\[
(1 + x)^1 = 1 + x \geq 1 + 1 \cdot x.
\]
The inequality holds with equality.

**Inductive Step**:
Assume \((1 + x)^k \geq 1 + k x\) for some \( k \geq 1 \). We need to show \((1 + x)^{k + 1} \geq 1 + (k + 1) x\).

Starting with the LHS:
\[
(1 + x)^{k + 1} = (1 + x)^k (1 + x).
\]
By the inductive hypothesis:
\[
(1 + x)^k (1 + x) \geq (1 + k x)(1 + x) = 1 + x + k x + k x^2.
\]
We need to show:
\[
1 + x + k x + k x^2 \geq 1 + (k + 1) x.
\]
Simplifying the inequality:
\[
1 + x + k x + k x^2 \geq 1 + k x + x.
\]
This reduces to:
\[
k x^2 \geq 0,
\]
which is true because \( k \geq 1 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \).

Thus, the inequality \((1 + x)^n \geq 1 + n x\) holds for all \( x > -1 \) and \( n \geq 1 \).

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Prove the Base Case (\( n = 1 \))**:
   - For \( n = 1 \), the inequality becomes \( 1 + x \leq 1 + x \), which is trivially true.

2. **Inductive Hypothesis**:
   - Assume that for some \( n \geq 1 \), \((1 + x)^n \geq 1 + n x\).

3. **Inductive Step (\( n + 1 \))**:
   - Show that \((1 + x)^{n + 1} \geq 1 + (n + 1) x\) using the inductive hypothesis and properties of inequalities.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - By induction, the inequality \((1 + x)^n \geq 1 + n x\) holds for all \( n \geq 1 \) and \( x > -1 \).
