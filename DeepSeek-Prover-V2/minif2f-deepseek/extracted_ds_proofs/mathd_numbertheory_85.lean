### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem correctly. The number `1222₃` is a 4-digit number in base 3. To convert it to base 10, we need to expand it using powers of 3:
\[ 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]

This is exactly the expression we are given in the Lean theorem statement. We need to compute this sum and verify that it equals `53`.

#### Step 1: Compute Each Term
1. \( 1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \)
2. \( 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \)
3. \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \)
4. The constant term is \( 2 \).

#### Step 2: Sum the Terms
\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 6 = 51 \]
\[ 51 + 2 = 53 \]

Thus, the total is `53`, as required.

### Step 3: Abstract Plan

1. **Expand the Base 3 Number**:
   - The number `1222₃` is `1 * 3³ + 2 * 3² + 2 * 3 + 2`.

2. **Compute Each Term Individually**:
   - `1 * 3³ = 27`.
   - `2 * 3² = 18`.
   - `2 * 3 = 6`.
   - The constant term is `2`.

3. **Sum the Results**:
   - `27 + 18 = 45`.
   - `45 + 6 = 51`.
   - `51 + 2 = 53`.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The total is `53`.

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_85 :
  1 * 3^3 + 2 * 3^2 + 2*3 + 2 = 53 := by
  have h₀ : 1 * 3^3 + 2 * 3^2 + 2*3 + 2 = 53 := by sorry
  sorry
```

This `have` statement directly reflects the final computation, and the proof is trivial once the computation is done. The `sorry` can be replaced with the actual computation steps in Lean.
