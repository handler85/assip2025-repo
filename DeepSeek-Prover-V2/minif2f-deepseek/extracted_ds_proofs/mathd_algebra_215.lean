### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem. We have a set `S` of real numbers `x` such that `(x + 3)² = 121`. We need to find the sum of all elements in `S` and show that it is `-6`.

#### Step 1: Find the Elements of `S`

The equation `(x + 3)² = 121` is equivalent to `x + 3 = 11` or `x + 3 = -11` because `121 = 11²` and `(x + 3)² = 11²` implies `x + 3 = 11` or `x + 3 = -11`.

1. **Case `x + 3 = 11`**:
   - `x = 11 - 3 = 8`

2. **Case `x + 3 = -11`**:
   - `x = -11 - 3 = -14`

Thus, the set `S` is `{8, -14}`.

#### Step 2: Compute the Sum of the Elements of `S`

The sum of the elements in `S` is `8 + (-14) = 8 - 14 = -6`.

#### Step 3: Verification

We can verify that `(8 + 3)² = 11² = 121` and `(-14 + 3)² = (-11)² = 121`, so both `8` and `-14` are indeed in `S`.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Find the Solutions to the Equation**:
   - Solve `(x + 3)² = 121` to get `x = 8` and `x = -14`.

2. **Construct the Set `S`**:
   - `S = {8, -14}`.

3. **Compute the Sum of the Elements in `S`**:
   - `8 + (-14) = -6`.

4. **Verify the Sum**:
   - Ensure that the sum is correct and matches the expected result.
