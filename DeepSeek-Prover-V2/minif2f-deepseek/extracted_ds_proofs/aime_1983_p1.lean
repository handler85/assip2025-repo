### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's recall the problem and the given conditions:
- \(x, y, z > 1\) (as natural numbers)
- \(w \geq 0\) (as a natural number)
- \(\log_x w = 24\) (as real numbers)
- \(\log_y w = 40\) (as real numbers)
- \(\log_{xyz} w = 12\) (as real numbers)
- We need to find \(\log_z w\) and show it is \(60\).

#### Step 1: Rewrite the logarithmic conditions in terms of natural logarithms
Recall that \(\log_b a = \frac{\ln a}{\ln b}\). Thus, the given conditions can be rewritten as:
1. \(\frac{\ln w}{\ln x} = 24\)
2. \(\frac{\ln w}{\ln y} = 40\)
3. \(\frac{\ln w}{\ln (x \cdot y \cdot z)}} = 12\)

#### Step 2: Simplify the denominators
The third condition can be simplified using the logarithm product rule:
\[ \ln (x \cdot y \cdot z) = \ln x + \ln y + \ln z \]
Thus, the third condition becomes:
\[ \frac{\ln w}{\ln x + \ln y + \ln z} = 12 \]

#### Step 3: Express \(\ln w\) in terms of the other logarithms
From the third condition:
\[ \ln w = 12 (\ln x + \ln y + \ln z) \]

#### Step 4: Use the first two conditions to find \(\ln z\)
From the first condition:
\[ \ln w = 24 \ln x \]
From the second condition:
\[ \ln w = 40 \ln y \]
Thus:
\[ 24 \ln x = 40 \ln y \]
\[ 6 \ln x = 10 \ln y \]
\[ 3 \ln x = 5 \ln y \]
\[ \ln x = \frac{5}{3} \ln y \]

#### Step 5: Substitute \(\ln x\) in terms of \(\ln y\) into the expression for \(\ln w\)
From Step 4:
\[ \ln w = 24 \ln x = 24 \cdot \frac{5}{3} \ln y = 40 \ln y \]
This is consistent with the second condition.

#### Step 6: Find \(\ln z\) in terms of \(\ln y\)
From the expression for \(\ln w\):
\[ \ln w = 12 (\ln x + \ln y + \ln z) \]
Substitute \(\ln x = \frac{5}{3} \ln y\):
\[ 40 \ln y = 12 \left( \frac{5}{3} \ln y + \ln y + \ln z \right) \]
\[ 40 \ln y = 12 \left( \frac{5}{3} \ln y + \ln y + \ln z \right) \]
\[ 40 \ln y = 12 \left( \frac{5 \ln y + 3 \ln y}{3} + \ln z \right) \]
\[ 40 \ln y = 12 \left( \frac{8 \ln y}{3} + \ln z \right) \]
\[ 40 \ln y = 32 \ln y + 12 \ln z \]
\[ 8 \ln y = 12 \ln z \]
\[ 2 \ln y = 3 \ln z \]
\[ \ln z = \frac{2}{3} \ln y \]

#### Step 7: Find \(\ln w / \ln z\)
From the expression for \(\ln w\):
\[ \ln w = 40 \ln y \]
Thus:
\[ \frac{\ln w}{\ln z} = \frac{40 \ln y}{\frac{2}{3} \ln y} = \frac{40 \ln y}{\frac{2}{3} \ln y} = 40 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 60 \]

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Convert all logarithmic conditions to natural logarithms**:
   - \(\log_x w = 24 \implies \frac{\ln w}{\ln x} = 24\)
   - \(\log_y w = 40 \implies \frac{\ln w}{\ln y} = 40\)
   - \(\log_{xyz} w = 12 \implies \frac{\ln w}{\ln (x \cdot y \cdot z)}} = 12\)

2. **Simplify the denominator \(\ln (x \cdot y \cdot z)\)**:
   - \(\ln (x \cdot y \cdot z) = \ln x + \ln y + \ln z\)

3. **Express \(\ln w\) in terms of \(\ln x\), \(\ln y\), and \(\ln z\)**:
   - From \(\frac{\ln w}{\ln x} = 24\), we get \(\ln w = 24 \ln x\)
   - From \(\frac{\ln w}{\ln y} = 40\), we get \(\ln w = 40 \ln y\)
   - From \(\frac{\ln w}{\ln x + \ln y + \ln z} = 12\), we get \(\ln w = 12 (\ln x + \ln y + \ln z)\)

4. **Find a relationship between \(\ln x\) and \(\ln y\)**:
   - From \(\ln w = 24 \ln x\) and \(\ln w = 40 \ln y\), we get \(24 \ln x = 40 \ln y \implies 3 \ln x = 5 \ln y \implies \ln x = \frac{5}{3} \ln y\)

5. **Find \(\ln z\) in terms of \(\ln y\)**:
   - Substitute \(\ln x = \frac{5}{3} \ln y\) into \(\ln w = 12 (\ln x + \ln y + \ln z)\) to get \(\ln w = 12 \left( \frac{5}{3} \ln y + \ln y + \ln z \right) = 12 \left( \frac{8}{3} \ln y + \ln z \right)\)
   - From \(\ln w = 40 \ln y\), we get \(40 \ln y = 12 \left( \frac{8}{3} \ln y + \ln z \right) = 32 \ln y + 12 \ln z\)
   - Simplify to get \(8 \ln y = 12 \ln z \implies 2 \ln y = 3 \ln z \implies \ln z = \frac{2}{3} \ln y\)

6. **Find \(\frac{\ln w}{\ln z}\)**:
   - From \(\ln w = 40 \ln y\) and \(\ln z = \frac{2}{3} \ln y\), we get \(\frac{\ln w}{\ln z} = \frac{40 \ln y}{\frac{2}{3} \ln y} = 60\)
