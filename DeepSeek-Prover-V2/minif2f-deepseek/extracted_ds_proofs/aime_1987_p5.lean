### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given the equation:
\[ y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \]
and we need to prove that:
\[ 3x^2 y^2 = 588. \]

#### Step 1: Factor the Left Side
Notice that the left side can be factored:
\[ y^2 (1 + 3x^2) = 30x^2 + 517. \]

#### Step 2: Find Possible Values of \(x^2\)
We can treat this as a Diophantine equation in \(x^2\) and \(y^2\). Let \(k = x^2\). Then:
\[ y^2 (1 + 3k) = 30k + 517. \]

We can rearrange this to:
\[ y^2 (1 + 3k) - 30k = 517. \]

Alternatively, we can consider that \(1 + 3k\) must divide \(30k + 517\).

First, we can find bounds for \(k\) (i.e., \(x^2\)) by noting that \(y^2 (1 + 3k) \geq 0\) and \(30k + 517 \geq 0\) (since \(y^2 \geq 0\) and \(k \geq 0\) is not necessarily true, but we can consider cases).

But we can also consider that \(y^2 (1 + 3k) = 30k + 517\) and \(y^2 \geq 0\) to get:
\[ 1 + 3k \leq 30k + 517 \implies 1 \leq 27k + 517 \implies 27k \geq -516 \implies k \geq -516/27, \]
which is always true since \(k \geq 0\).

But we can also consider that \(y^2 (1 + 3k) = 30k + 517\) and \(1 + 3k \geq 0\) (since \(k \geq 0\) is not necessarily true, but we can consider cases).
