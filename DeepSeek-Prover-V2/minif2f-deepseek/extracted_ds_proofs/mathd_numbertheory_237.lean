/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the sum of the first 100 natural numbers and then find its modulo 6 remainder.

The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is given by the formula:
\[ S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

For \( n = 100 \):
\[ S = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = 50 \times 101 = 5050 \]

Now, we need to find \( 5050 \mod 6 \).

First, simplify \( 5050 \mod 6 \):
\[ 5050 \div 6 = 841 \times 6 + 4 \]
\[ 5050 = 841 \times 6 + 4 \]
\[ 5050 \mod 6 = 4 \]

Alternatively, we can compute \( 5050 \mod 6 \) by reducing each digit modulo 6:
\[ 5050 \mod 6 = (5 \times 1000 + 0 \times 100 + 5 \times 10 + 0) \mod 6 \]
\[ = (5 \times (1000 \mod 6) + 0 \times (100 \mod 6) + 5 \times (10 \mod 6) + 0) \mod 6 \]
\[ = (5 \times 4 + 0 \times 4 + 5 \times 4 + 0) \mod 6 \]
\[ = (20 + 0 + 20 + 0) \mod 6 \]
\[ = 40 \mod 6 \]
\[ = 4 \]

Both methods confirm that the remainder is 4.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Calculate the Sum**:
   - The sum of the first 100 natural numbers is \( S = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = 5050 \).

2. **Find the Remainder Modulo 6**:
   - Compute \( 5050 \mod 6 \).
   - Simplify \( 5050 \) modulo 6 step by step:
     - \( 5050 \div 6 = 841 \) with a remainder of \( 4 \), so \( 5050 \mod 6 = 4 \).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The remainder when the sum is divided by 6 is 4.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_237 : (∑ k in Finset.range 101, k) % 6 = 4 := by
  have h_sum : (∑ k in Finset.range 101, k) = 5050 := by sorry
  have h_mod : 5050 % 6 = 4 := by sorry
  have h_final : (∑ k in Finset.range 101, k) % 6 = 4 := by sorry
  exact h_final
```
