### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` (indexed from `0` to `n-1` in Lean) such that the sum of the first `n` terms is `n`. We need to prove that the product of the first `n` terms is at most `1`.

**Key Observations:**
1. The product of nonnegative real numbers is maximized when all the numbers are equal (by the AM-GM inequality).
2. The sum of the terms is `n`, so if all terms were `1`, the product would be `1`.
3. If any term is greater than `1`, the sum would exceed `n`, and if any term is less than `1`, the product would be less than `1` (but the sum could still be `n`).

**Proof Sketch:**
1. By the AM-GM inequality, the product of the terms is at most `1` when the sum of the terms is `n`.
2. Alternatively, we can use the fact that the product is maximized when all terms are equal to `1` (since the sum is `n`).
3. The maximum product is `1`, achieved when all `a_i = 1`.

**Detailed Proof:**
1. The product `∏_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i` is maximized when all `a_i` are equal (by the AM-GM inequality).
2. The sum of the `a_i` is `n`, so the average is `1`.
3. The maximum product is therefore `1^n = 1`, achieved when all `a_i = 1`.
4. Hence, `∏_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i ≤ 1`.

**Alternative Proof (Direct):**
1. If all `a_i = 1`, the product is `1` and the sum is `n`.
2. If not all `a_i = 1`, some `a_i > 1` and some `a_j < 1` (or all `a_i > 1` or all `a_i < 1`).
   - The product is maximized when the `a_i` are as equal as possible.
   - The product is minimized when the `a_i` are as unequal as possible.
   - The maximum product is `1`, achieved when all `a_i = 1`.
3. Hence, `∏_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i ≤ 1`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We have a sequence of nonnegative real numbers summing to `n`.
   - We need to bound the product of these numbers.

2. **Key Idea**:
   - The product is maximized when all numbers are equal (by AM-GM).
   - The sum is `n`, so the average is `1`, and the maximum product is `1`.

3. **Proof Steps**:
   - The product is maximized when all `a_i` are equal to `1` (since the sum is `n`).
   - The maximum product is `1^n = 1`.
   - Hence, the product is at most `1`.
