### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers:
1. \(6, a, b\)
2. \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\)

We need to solve for \(a\) and show that it is \(3\sqrt{2}\).

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Sequences
A geometric sequence is one where each term is a constant multiple of the previous term. 

For the first sequence \(6, a, b\):
- The common ratio is \(r_1 = \frac{a}{6}\).
- The third term is \(b = 6 \cdot r_1^2 = 6 \cdot \left(\frac{a}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{6}\).

For the second sequence \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\):
- The common ratio is \(r_2 = \frac{a}{\frac{1}{b}} = a \cdot b\).
- The third term is \(54 = \frac{1}{b} \cdot r_2^2 = \frac{1}{b} \cdot (a \cdot b)^2 = a^2 \cdot b\).

But we can also express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) from the first sequence:
\[ b = \frac{a^2}{6} \]

Substitute this into the second sequence's third term:
\[ 54 = a^2 \cdot b = a^2 \cdot \frac{a^2}{6} = \frac{a^4}{6} \]
Multiply both sides by 6:
\[ 324 = a^4 \]
Take the fourth root (or square root twice):
\[ a^2 = 18 \]
\[ a = \sqrt{18} = 3 \sqrt{2} \]

#### Verification
1. For the first sequence:
   - \(a = 3 \sqrt{2}\), \(b = \frac{a^2}{6} = \frac{18}{6} = 3\).
   - Check the common ratio: \(\frac{a}{6} = \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).
   - The sequence is \(6, 3 \sqrt{2}, 3\).

2. For the second sequence:
   - \(a = 3 \sqrt{2}\), \(b = 3\).
   - Check the common ratio: \(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{3} = \sqrt{2}\).
   - The sequence is \(\frac{1}{3}, 3 \sqrt{2}, 54\).
   - Check the third term: \(54 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot (\sqrt{2})^4 \cdot 3^2 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 4 \cdot 9 = 12\) ? No, this is incorrect. 

   **Correction:** The second sequence is \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), not \(\frac{1}{3}, 3 \sqrt{2}, 54\). 

   Given \(b = 3\), the first term is \(\frac{1}{3}\), the second term is \(3 \sqrt{2}\), and the third term is \(54\). 

   The common ratio is \(\frac{a}{\frac{1}{b}} = a \cdot b = 3 \sqrt{2} \cdot 3 = 9 \sqrt{2}\). 

   The third term is \(54 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot (9 \sqrt{2})^2 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 162 = 54\). 

   This checks out. 

Thus, the solution is correct.

### Step 2: Abstract Plan

1. **Express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) from the first sequence**:
   - The first sequence is \(6, a, b\).
   - The common ratio is \(r_1 = \frac{a}{6}\).
   - The third term is \(b = 6 \cdot r_1^2 = \frac{a^2}{6}\).

2. **Substitute \(b\) into the second sequence's third term**:
   - The second sequence is \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\).
   - The common ratio is \(r_2 = \frac{a}{\frac{1}{b}} = a \cdot b\).
   - The third term is \(54 = \frac{1}{b} \cdot r_2^2 = \frac{1}{b} \cdot (a \cdot b)^2 = a^2 \cdot b\).

3. **Solve for \(a\)**:
   - From the first sequence, \(b = \frac{a^2}{6}\).
   - Substitute into the second sequence's third term: \(54 = a^2 \cdot \frac{a^2}{6} = \frac{a^4}{6}\).
   - Multiply by 6: \(324 = a^4\).
   - Take the fourth root: \(a^2 = 18\), so \(a = \sqrt{18} = 3 \sqrt{2}\).

### Step 3: Lean 4 `have` Statements
