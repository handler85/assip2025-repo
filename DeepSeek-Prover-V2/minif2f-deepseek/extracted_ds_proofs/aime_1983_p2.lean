### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem:
- We have a function \( f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \), where \( 0 < p < 15 \).
- The variable \( x \) is constrained to \( p \leq x \leq 15 \).
- We need to prove that \( f(x) \geq 15 \) for all \( x \) in this interval.

#### Key Observations:
1. The expression \( |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \) can be simplified or interpreted in terms of distances.
2. The condition \( p \leq x \leq 15 \) is given, so we can drop the absolute values based on the ordering of the terms.

#### Simplifying the Expression:
Given \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we have:
- \( x - p \geq 0 \), so \( |x - p| = x - p \).
- \( x - 15 \leq 0 \), so \( |x - 15| = 15 - x \).
- \( x - p - 15 \leq 0 \) (since \( x \leq 15 \) and \( p > 0 \), but this is not immediately obvious. We need to check:
  - \( x - p - 15 \leq 0 \) is equivalent to \( x \leq p + 15 \).
  - Since \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), \( x \leq 15 \leq p + 15 \) is not necessarily true (e.g., \( p = 14 \), \( x = 15 \), then \( x = 15 \leq 14 + 15 = 29 \) is true, but if \( p \) is close to 0, \( x \leq p + 15 \) is not guaranteed).
  - Hmm, this is incorrect. Let's re-examine:
    - \( x \leq 15 \) and \( p > 0 \), so \( x - p - 15 \leq 15 - p - 15 = -p \leq 0 \), since \( p > 0 \).
    - Thus, \( x - p - 15 \leq 0 \), so \( |x - p - 15| = p + 15 - x \).

But wait, this seems incorrect. Let's re-express \( |x - p - 15| \):
- \( x \leq 15 \), \( p > 0 \), so \( x - p - 15 \leq 15 - p - 15 = -p \leq 0 \), since \( p > 0 \).
- Thus, \( x - p - 15 \leq 0 \), so \( |x - p - 15| = p + 15 - x \).

Therefore, the expression for \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (p + 15 - x) = 15. \]

But wait, this seems too simple. Did I make a mistake?

#### Verification:
Let's re-express \( f(x) \) step by step:
1. \( |x - p| = x - p \) (since \( x \geq p \) by \( p \leq x \)).
2. \( |x - 15| = 15 - x \) (since \( x \leq 15 \)).
3. \( |x - p - 15| = |x - (p + 15)| \).
   - Since \( x \leq 15 \) and \( p > 0 \), \( x - (p + 15) \leq 15 - (p + 15) = -p \leq 0 \).
   - Thus, \( |x - p - 15| = p + 15 - x \).

Therefore:
\[ f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (p + 15 - x) = x - p + 15 - x + p + 15 - x = (x - x) + (-p + p) + (15 + 15) - x = 30 - x. \]

But this contradicts our earlier simplification. The mistake is in the third step:
- \( |x - p - 15| = p + 15 - x \), not \( x - p - 15 \).

Thus, the correct expression is:
\[ f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (p + 15 - x) = 30 - x. \]

But the problem states that \( f(x) \geq 15 \), i.e., \( 30 - x \geq 15 \), or \( x \leq 15 \). This is consistent with the given condition \( x \leq 15 \).

But wait, the original problem is:
\[ f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15|. \]

Given \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we have:
1. \( |x - p| = x - p \).
2. \( |x - 15| = 15 - x \).
3. \( |x - p - 15| = |x - (p + 15)| \).
   - Since \( x \leq 15 \) and \( p > 0 \), \( x - (p + 15) \leq 15 - (p + 15) = -p \leq 0 \).
   - Thus, \( |x - p - 15| = p + 15 - x \).

Therefore:
\[ f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (p + 15 - x) = 30 - x. \]

But the problem asks to prove \( f(x) \geq 15 \), i.e., \( 30 - x \geq 15 \), or \( x \leq 15 \). This is exactly the given condition \( x \leq 15 \).

Thus, the proof is complete.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Given Conditions**:
   - \( 0 < p < 15 \).
   - \( p \leq x \leq 15 \).
   - \( f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \).

2. **Simplify the Absolute Values**:
   - Since \( p \leq x \), \( |x - p| = x - p \).
   - Since \( x \leq 15 \), \( |x - 15| = 15 - x \).
   - Since \( x \leq 15 \) and \( p > 0 \), \( |x - p - 15| = p + 15 - x \).

3. **Compute \( f(x) \)**:
   - \( f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (p + 15 - x) = 30 - x \).

4. **Prove the Inequality**:
   - \( f(x) \geq 15 \) is equivalent to \( 30 - x \geq 15 \), i.e., \( x \leq 15 \).
   - This is exactly the given condition.
