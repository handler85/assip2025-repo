### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall that `Nat.ofDigits 10 [0, 1, C, M, A]` is the 5-digit number `A * 10^4 + M * 10^3 + C * 10^2 + 1 * 10^1 + 0 * 10^0 = A * 10000 + M * 1000 + C * 100 + 10` (since `10^0 = 1` and `10^1 = 10`). Similarly, `Nat.ofDigits 10 [2, 1, C, M, A]` is `2 * 10000 + 1 * 1000 + C * 100 + M * 10 + A = 20000 + 1000 + 100 * C + 10 * M + A`.

The equation becomes:
`(A * 10000 + M * 1000 + C * 100 + 10) + (20000 + 1000 + 100 * C + 10 * M + A) = 123422`.

Simplify the left-hand side:
`(A * 10000 + A) + (M * 1000 + 10 * M) + (C * 100 + 100 * C) + (20000 + 1000) + 10 = 10001 * A + 1010 * M + 110 * C + 21000 + 10 = 10001 * A + 1010 * M + 110 * C + 21010`.

Thus, the equation is:
`10001 * A + 1010 * M + 110 * C + 21010 = 123422`.

Subtract 21010 from both sides:
`10001 * A + 1010 * M + 110 * C = 102412`.

Now, we can try to find `A`, `M`, and `C` that satisfy this equation. Since `A`, `M`, and `C` are digits (`0` to `9`), we can try to find `A` first.

Assume `A = 9`:
`10001 * 9 + 1010 * M + 110 * C = 90009 + 1010 * M + 110 * C = 102412`.

Subtract 90009 from both sides:
`1010 * M + 110 * C = 12393`.

Assume `M = 9`:
`1010 * 9 + 110 * C = 9090 + 110 * C = 12393`.

Subtract 9090 from both sides:
`110 * C = 3303`.

But `110 * C` is at most `110 * 9 = 990`, so this is impossible.

Assume `M = 8`:
`1010 * 8 + 110 * C = 8080 + 110 * C = 12393`.

Subtract 8080 from both sides:
`110 * C = 4313`.

But `110 * C` is at most `110 * 9 = 990`, so this is impossible.

Assume `M = 7`:
`1010 * 7 + 110 * C = 7070 + 110 * C = 12393`.

Subtract 7070 from both sides:
`110 * C = 5323`.

But `110 * C` is at most `110 * 9 = 990`, so this is impossible.

Assume `M = 6`:
`1010 * 6 + 110 * C = 6060 + 110 * C = 12393`.

But `110 * C` is at most `110 * 9 = 990`, so this is impossible.

Assume `M = 1`:
`1010 * 1 + 110 * C = 1010 + 110 * C = 12393`.

Since `A = 9` leads to no solution, we try `A = 8`:
`10001 * 8 + 1010 * M + 110 * C = 80008 + 1010 * M + 110 * C = 102412`.

Subtract 80008 from both sides:
`1010 * M + 110 * C = 22404`.

Assume `M = 9`:
`1010 * 9 + 110 * C = 9090 + 110 * C = 22404`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We need to find digits \( A, M, C \) such that \( 10001A + 1010M + 110C = 102412 \).

2. **Explore the Possibilities**:
   - We start by testing possible values for \( A \) and find corresponding \( M \) and \( C \).

3. **Test \( A = 7 \)**:
   - For \( A = 7 \):
     - \( 10001 \times 7 = 70007 \).
     - \( 1010 \times M + 110 \times C = 102412 - 70007 = 32405 \).
     - \( 1010 \times M + 110 \times C = 32405 \).

4. **Solve for \( M \) and \( C \)**:
   - \( 1010 \times M + 110 \times C = 32405 \).
   - \( M = 32405 \div 1010 = 32 \).
   - \( 1010 \times 32 = 32320 \).
   - \( 110 \times C = 32320 - 32320 = 0 \).

5. **Final Solution**:
   - \( 110 \times C = 0 \).
   - \( 1010 \times 32 = 32320 \).
   - \( 110 \times C = 32320 - 32320 = 0 \).
