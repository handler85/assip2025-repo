### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the recurrence relations:
1. \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{3} a_n - b_n \)
2. \( b_{n+1} = \sqrt{3} b_n + a_n \)

We are given \( a_{100} = 2 \) and \( b_{100} = 4 \), and we need to find \( a_1 + b_1 \).

#### Step 1: Find a Pattern or Closed Form

The recurrence relations resemble those of a rotation in the plane by \( \pi/3 \) (or \( 60^\circ \)), but with a scaling factor of \( \sqrt{3} \).

However, the given problem is simpler because we are only interested in the initial condition and the final condition, and we can work backward to find \( a_1 + b_1 \).

#### Step 2: Work Backward from \( n = 100 \) to \( n = 1 \)

We can express \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) in terms of \( a_{n+1} \) and \( b_{n+1} \):
1. \( a_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} (a_{n+1} + b_n) \)
2. \( b_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} (b_{n+1} - a_n) \)

But this seems circular. Instead, we can use the given recurrence to find a relationship between \( a_1 + b_1 \) and \( a_{100} + b_{100} \).

#### Step 3: Find a General Relationship

Let's compute \( a_{n+1} + b_{n+1} \):
\[
a_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = (\sqrt{3} a_n - b_n) + (\sqrt{3} b_n + a_n) = 2 \sqrt{3} a_n + (\sqrt{3} b_n - b_n) = 2 \sqrt{3} a_n + \sqrt{3} b_n - b_n.
\]
This doesn't seem immediately helpful.

Alternatively, let's compute \( a_{n+1} - b_{n+1} \):
\[
a_{n+1} - b_{n+1} = (\sqrt{3} a_n - b_n) - (\sqrt{3} b_n + a_n) = \sqrt{3} a_n - b_n - \sqrt{3} b_n - a_n = (\sqrt{3} - 1) a_n - (\sqrt{3} + 1) b_n.
\]
This also doesn't seem immediately helpful.

#### Step 4: Find a Simpler Relationship

Let's consider the product \( a_n b_n \):
\[
a_n b_n = (\sqrt{3} a_{n-1} - b_{n-1}) (\sqrt{3} b_{n-1} + a_{n-1}) = (\sqrt{3} a_{n-1} - b_{n-1}) (\sqrt{3} b_{n-1} + a_{n-1}).
\]
This seems complicated.

#### Step 5: Look for a Pattern

Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges:
1. \( a_1, b_1 \)
2. \( a_2 = \sqrt{3} a_1 - b_1 \)
3. \( b_2 = \sqrt{3} b_1 + a_1 \)
4. \( a_3 = \sqrt{3} a_2 - b_2 = \sqrt{3} (\sqrt{3} a_1 - b_1) - (\sqrt{3} b_1 + a_1) = 3 a_1 - \sqrt{3} b_1 - \sqrt{3} b_1 - a_1 = 2 a_1 - 2 \sqrt{3} b_1 \)
5. \( b_3 = \sqrt{3} b_2 + a_2 = \sqrt{3} (\sqrt{3} b_1 + a_1) + (\sqrt{3} a_1 - b_1) = 3 b_1 + \sqrt{3} a_1 + \sqrt{3} a_1 - b_1 = 2 b_1 + 2 \sqrt{3} a_1 \)

This seems messy, but perhaps we can find a pattern for \( a_n \) and \( b_n \).

#### Step 6: Find a General Solution

Let's assume that \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) can be expressed in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( b_1 \).

From the computations above, we can observe that:
1. \( a_2 = \sqrt{3} a_1 - b_1 \)
2. \( b_2 = \sqrt{3} b_1 + a_1 \)
3. \( a_3 = 2 a_1 - 2 \sqrt{3} b_1 \)
4. \( b_3 = 2 b_1 + 2 \sqrt{3} a_1 \)

This suggests that \( a_n \) and \( b_n \) are linear combinations of \( a_1 \) and \( b_1 \), and the coefficients are powers of 2 and \( \sqrt{3} \).

#### Step 7: Find \( a_1 + b_1 \)

Given that \( a_{100} = 2 \) and \( b_{100} = 4 \), we can work backward to find \( a_1 + b_1 \).

However, this seems tedious. Instead, let's consider the following approach:

From the pattern, we can observe that:
\[
a_n = 2^{n-100} a_1 + \text{terms involving } b_1
\]
\[
b_n = 2^{n-100} b_1 + \text{terms involving } a_1
\]

But this is not precise.

Instead, let's consider the following:

From the computations, we can observe that:
\[
a_{n+1} = \sqrt{3} a_n - b_n
\]
\[
b_{n+1} = \sqrt{3} b_n + a_n
\]

This is a linear recurrence relation.

The characteristic equation is:
\[
r^2 - 2 \sqrt{3} r + 4 = 0
\]

The roots are:
\[
r = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{12 - 16}}{2} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{-4}}{2} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \pm 2 i \sqrt{1}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \pm i
\]

Thus, the general solution is:
\[
a_n = e^{\sqrt{3} n} (A \cos n + B \sin n)
\]
\[
b_n = e^{\sqrt{3} n} (C \cos n + D \sin n)
