/- ### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that:
1. \( x + y = 25 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( x - y = 11 \) (Equation 2)

We need to find the value of \( x \).

**Approach:**
To solve for \( x \), we can use the two given equations to eliminate one of the variables. Here, we can add the two equations to eliminate \( y \), or we can subtract them to eliminate \( x \).

**Step 1: Add the two equations to eliminate \( y \).**

Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:
\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11 \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ x + y + x - y = 2x \]
So:
\[ 2x = 36 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 18 \]

This gives us the desired result.

**Verification:**
We can also verify that \( y = 7 \) by substituting \( x = 18 \) back into one of the original equations. For example, using \( x + y = 25 \):
\[ 18 + y = 25 \]
\[ y = 7 \]

Alternatively, using \( x - y = 11 \):
\[ 18 - y = 11 \]
\[ y = 7 \]

Both methods confirm that \( y = 7 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Add the two given equations to eliminate \( y \):**
   - Add \( x + y = 25 \) and \( x - y = 11 \).
   - The \( y \) terms cancel out, leaving \( 2x = 36 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 2 to get \( x = 18 \).

3. **Verify the solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 18 \) back into one of the original equations to find \( y \).
