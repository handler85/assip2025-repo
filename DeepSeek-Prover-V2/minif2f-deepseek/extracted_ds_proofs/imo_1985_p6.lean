### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's carefully understand the problem and the given conditions.

#### Problem Understanding:
We have a sequence of functions `f : ℕ → NNReal → ℝ` (where `NNReal` is the non-negative reals) with the following properties:
1. For every `x : NNReal`, `f 1 x = x` (i.e., `f` at `n = 1` is the identity function).
2. For every `x : NNReal` and `n : ℕ`, `f (n + 1) x = f n x * (f n x + 1 / n)`.

We need to prove that there exists a unique `a : NNReal` such that for every `n : ℕ` with `n > 0`, the following holds:
1. `0 < f n a`,
2. `f n a < f (n + 1) a`,
3. `f (n + 1) a < 1`.

#### Observations:
1. The condition `f 1 x = x` is given, but the recurrence relation is given for `f (n + 1) x` in terms of `f n x`.
2. The recurrence relation is not well-defined for `n = 0` because `1 / n` is undefined when `n = 0` (Lean's `1 / (0 : ℕ)` is `0` by definition, but mathematically it is undefined).
   - However, Lean's `NNReal` is `ℕ → ℝ` with `x ≥ 0` and `1 / (0 : ℕ) = 0` in Lean.
   - The recurrence is given for `n : ℕ` and `x : NNReal`, but `1 / n` is `0` when `n = 0` (Lean's `Nat`).
   - So, `f (0 + 1) x = f 0 x * (f 0 x + 1 / 0) = f 0 x * (f 0 x + 0) = f 0 x * f 0 x`.
   - But `f 1 x = x` is given, so `f 0 x` is not directly constrained.
   - However, the problem is vacuously true for `n = 0` because `0 < n` is false.
   - The condition is only for `n > 0`, so we can ignore `n = 0` in the recurrence.

3. The recurrence is `f (n + 1) x = f n x * (f n x + 1 / n)`.
   - For `n = 1`, `f 2 x = f 1 x * (f 1 x + 1 / 1) = x * (x + 1) = x² + x`.
   - For `n = 2`, `f 3 x = f 2 x * (f 2 x + 1 / 2) = (x² + x) * (x² + x + 1/2)`.
   - This seems complicated, but we can try to find a pattern or a fixed point.

4. The problem is to find a unique `a : NNReal` such that for all `n > 0`, `0 < f n a < f (n + 1) a < 1`.
   - The condition `f n a < f (n + 1) a` is always true because `f (n + 1) a = f n a * (f n a + 1 / n) > f n a` (since `f n a > 0` and `1 / n > 0`).
   - The condition `0 < f n a` is also always true because `f 1 a = a` and `f (n + 1) a = f n a * (f n a + 1 / n) > 0` if `f n a > 0` (since `1 / n > 0`).
   - The condition `f (n + 1) a < 1` is the most restrictive.
   - We need to find `a : NNReal` such that for all `n > 0`, `f n a * (f n a + 1 / n) < 1`.

5. Let's find a candidate for `a`.
   - For `n = 1`, `f 1 a = a`, so `a * (a + 1) < 1` → `a² + a - 1 < 0`.
     The roots of `a² + a - 1 = 0` are `a = (-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4)) / 2 = (-1 ± sqrt(5)) / 2`.
     The positive root is `a = (-1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 ≈ 0.618`.
   - For `n = 2`, `f 2 a = a² + a`, so `(a² + a) * (a² + a + 1/2) < 1`.
     This seems complicated, but we can try `a = (-1 + sqrt(5)) / 2` and check numerically that it works for all `n > 0`.
   - Alternatively, we can guess that `a = 0` is a solution, but `f 1 0 = 0` and `f (n + 1) 0 = 0` for all `n > 0`, so `f n 0 = 0` for all `n > 0`, and the condition `0 < f n a` fails.
   - Another guess is `a = 1`, but `f 1 1 = 1`, `f 2 1 = 1 * (1 + 1) = 2`, `f 3 1 = 2 * (2 + 1/2) = 5`, and `f (n + 1) 1` grows without bound, so `f (n + 1) 1 > 1` for all `n > 0`, and the condition `f (n + 1) a < 1` fails.
   - The correct `a` is `a = (-1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 ≈ 0.618`.

6. To prove that `a = (-1 + sqrt(5)) / 2` is the unique solution, we need to show that for all `n > 0`, `f n a * (f n a + 1 / n) < 1`.
   - This is true because `f n a` is decreasing in `n` and approaches `(-1 + sqrt(5)) / 2` as `n → ∞`, and the product `f n a * (f n a + 1 / n)` is maximized at `n = 1` and decreases as `n` increases.
   - The exact proof requires bounding `f n a` and showing that the product is less than `1` for all `n > 0`.

#### Abstract Plan:
1. **Find the candidate `a`**:
   - Solve `a * (a + 1) < 1` to get `a = (-1 + sqrt(5)) / 2`.

2. **Prove `a` is the unique solution**:
   - For all `n > 0`, `f n a * (f n a + 1 / n) < 1` is true because `f n a` is decreasing and approaches `a` as `n → ∞`.

3. **Uniqueness**:
   - If there were another `a' ≠ a` satisfying the condition, `f n a'` would not satisfy `f n a' * (f n a' + 1 / n) < 1` for all `n > 0`, leading to a contradiction.
