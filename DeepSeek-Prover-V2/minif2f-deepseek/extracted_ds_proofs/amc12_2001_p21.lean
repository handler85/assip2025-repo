### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall that \(8! = 40320\). The problem gives four positive integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that:
1. \(ab \cdot cd = 40320\),
2. \(ab + a + b = 524\),
3. \(bc + b + c = 146\),
4. \(cd + c + d = 104\).

We need to find \(a - d = 10\).

#### Step 1: Solve for \(ab\) and \(cd\)
From the first equation, \(ab \cdot cd = 40320\). We can write this as:
\[ ab \cdot cd = 40320. \]

But we also have \(ab + a + b = 524\) and \(cd + c + d = 104\).

#### Step 2: Find a relationship between \(ab\) and \(cd\)
Notice that:
\[ ab + a + b = ab + (a + b) = 524, \]
\[ cd + c + d = cd + (c + d) = 104. \]

But we can write \(a + b = (a + 1)(b + 1) - (a b + 1)\), but this seems complicated. Alternatively, we can think of \(a + b\) and \(c + d\) as divisors of 524 and 104, respectively.

First, factorize 524 and 104:
\[ 524 = 4 \times 131, \]
\[ 104 = 8 \times 13. \]

But \(a + b\) and \(c + d\) are positive integers, so:
\[ a + b = 524 \text{ or } 262 \text{ or } 131 \text{ or } 4, \]
\[ c + d = 104 \text{ or } 52 \text{ or } 26 \text{ or } 8 \text{ or } 4 \text{ or } 2 \text{ or } 1. \]

But we also have \(ab \cdot cd = 40320\).

#### Step 3: Find possible pairs \((ab, cd)\)
We can try to find all possible pairs \((ab, cd)\) such that \(ab \cdot cd = 40320\) and \(ab, cd\) are divisors of 40320.

First, factorize 40320:
\[ 40320 = 2^7 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7. \]

The number of divisors of 40320 is \((7 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 8 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 = 96\).

We can list all the divisors of 40320 and find all pairs \((ab, cd)\) such that \(ab \cdot cd = 40320\).

But this is tedious. Instead, we can try to find possible values of \(ab\) and \(cd\) by considering the possible values of \(a + b\) and \(c + d\).

#### Step 4: Find possible values of \(a + b\) and \(c + d\)
From the factorization of 524 and 104, we have:
\[ a + b \in \{4, 131, 262, 524\}, \]
\[ c + d \in \{1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52, 104\}. \]

But we also have \(ab \cdot cd = 40320\).

#### Step 5: Find possible values of \(ab\) and \(cd\)
We can try to find all possible pairs \((ab, cd)\) such that \(ab \cdot cd = 40320\) and \(ab, cd\) are divisors of 40320.

First, list all the divisors of 40320:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 28, 30, 32, 35, 36, 40, 42, 45, 48, 56, 60, 63, 64, 70, 72, 80, 84, 90, 96, 105, 112, 120, 126, 128, 140, 144, 160, 168, 180, 192, 210, 224, 240, 252, 256, 280, 288, 315, 320, 336, 360, 384, 420, 448, 480, 504, 560, 576, 630, 640, 672, 720, 768, 840, 896, 960, 1008, 1120, 1152, 1260, 1344, 1440, 1680, 1792, 1920, 2016, 2240, 2304, 2520, 2688, 2880, 3360, 3840, 4032, 4480, 5040, 5376, 5760, 6720, 8064, 8960, 10080, 11520, 13440, 16128, 20160, 26880, 40320. \]

We can now find all pairs \((ab, cd)\) such that \(ab \cdot cd = 40320\).

First, find all possible \(ab\) and \(cd\) such that \(ab \leq cd\) and \(ab \cdot cd = 40320\).

We can list all the divisors of 40320 and pair them such that \(ab \leq cd\).

But this is tedious. Instead, we can use the fact that \(ab \cdot cd = 40320\) and \(ab, cd\) are divisors of 40320.
