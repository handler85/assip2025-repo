### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem. We have a sequence `a : ℕ → ℕ` and some hypotheses about the cubes of its terms:
1. `(a 0)^3 = 1`
2. `(a 1)^3 = 8`
3. `(a 2)^3 = 27`
4. `(a 3)^3 = 64`
5. `(a 4)^3 = 125`
6. `(a 5)^3 = 216`
7. `(a 6)^3 = 343`

We are to compute the value of the expression:
`∑ k in Finset.range 7, (6 * (a k)^2) - 2 * ∑ k in Finset.range 6, (a k)^2`
and show that it equals `658`.

#### Step 1: Compute the Sums Involved

First, we need to compute the sums:
1. `∑ k in Finset.range 7, (6 * (a k)^2)`
2. `∑ k in Finset.range 6, (a k)^2`

But we don't know the values of `a k` for `k ≥ 7` because the problem only gives us the cubes up to `k = 6`. However, the problem is about `∑ k in Finset.range 7, (6 * (a k)^2)`, which is `k` from `0` to `6` (since `Finset.range 7 = {0, ..., 6}`). 

But wait, the Lean code is `∑ k in Finset.range 7, (6 * (a k)^2)`, which is `k` from `0` to `6` (since `Finset.range 7` is `{0, ..., 6}`).

### Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We need to compute the sum of `6 * (a k)^2` for `k` from `0` to `6` and the sum of `(a k)^2` for `k` from `0` to `5`, given the cubes of `a k` for `k` from `0` to `6`.

2. **Compute the Sums**:
   - The first sum is `∑ k in Finset.range 7, (6 * (a k)^2)`, which is `6 * ∑ k in Finset.range 7, (a k)^2`.
   - The second sum is `∑ k in Finset.range 6, (a k)^2`.

3. **Use the Given Cubes**:
   - We are given `(a k)^3` for `k` from `0` to `6`.
   - We can express `(a k)^2` in terms of `(a k)^3` as `(a k)^2 = (a k)^3 / a k` (assuming `a k ≠ 0`).
   - However, since `(a k)^3` is given for `k` from `0` to `6`, we can directly compute `(a k)^2` for `k` from `0` to `6` by taking square roots of the cubes.

4. **Compute the Final Expression**:
   - The first sum is `6 * (∑ k in Finset.range 6, (a k)^2 + (a 6)^2)`.
   - The second sum is `∑ k in Finset.range 6, (a k)^2`.
   - The difference is `6 * (a 6)^2 - ∑ k in Finset.range 6, (a k)^2`.

5. **Verify the Result**:
   - Substitute the given values to ensure the final expression is correct.
