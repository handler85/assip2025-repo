### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's restate the problem clearly:
1. We have two positive integers `x` and `y` such that `5 * x = y`.
2. Three years ago, the sum of their ages was `30`. However, since we are working with natural numbers, the correct interpretation is that `(x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30` (assuming `x ≥ 3` and `y ≥ 3`).
3. We need to prove that `x = 6`.

#### Step 1: Substitute `y` in the second equation
Given `5 * x = y`, we can substitute `y` in the second equation:
`(x - 3) + (5 * x - 3) = 30`.

#### Step 2: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:
`(x - 3) + (5 * x - 3) = x + 5 * x - 3 - 3 = 6 * x - 6`.
So, `6 * x - 6 = 30`.

#### Step 3: Solve for `x`
Add `6` to both sides:
`6 * x = 36`.
Divide both sides by `6`:
`x = 6`.

#### Verification
If `x = 6`, then `y = 5 * x = 30`.
Three years ago:
`x - 3 = 3`, `y - 3 = 27`, and `(x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30`, which matches the condition.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Substitute `y` in terms of `x`**:
   - Use `5 * x = y` to replace `y` in the second equation.

2. **Simplify the equation**:
   - Expand `(x - 3) + (5 * x - 3)` to `6 * x - 6`.
   - Set `6 * x - 6 = 30`.

3. **Solve for `x`**:
   - Add `6` to both sides to get `6 * x = 36`.
   - Divide by `6` to get `x = 6`.

4. **Verify the solution**:
   - Check that `x = 6` and `y = 30` satisfy all original conditions.
