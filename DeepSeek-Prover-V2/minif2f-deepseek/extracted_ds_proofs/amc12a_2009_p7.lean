### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem. We have a sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` with the following properties:
1. For all `m : ℕ`, `a (m + 1) - a m = a (m + 2) - a (m + 1)`.
2. `a 1 = 2 * x - 3`.
3. `a 2 = 5 * x - 11`.
4. `a 3 = 3 * x + 1`.
5. There exists some `n : ℕ` such that `a n = 2009`.

We need to prove that `n = 502`.

#### Step 1: Understand the Recurrence Relation
The condition `a (m + 1) - a m = a (m + 2) - a (m + 1)` can be rewritten as:
`2 * (a (m + 1) - a m) = a (m + 2) - a m`.

This is a second-order linear recurrence relation. To find a general solution, we can first find the common difference `d` of the sequence.

#### Step 2: Find the Common Difference `d`
The sequence is arithmetic, so the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let `d` be this common difference. Then:
`a (m + 1) - a m = d` for all `m`.

But from the recurrence, we have:
`a (m + 1) - a m = a (m + 2) - a (m + 1) = d`.

Thus, the recurrence simplifies to `d = d`, which is trivially true. This means that the common difference `d` is arbitrary, and the sequence is not fully determined by the given conditions.

But wait, this is incorrect! The recurrence is not `d = d` but rather a condition on `d`. The condition is that the common difference is the same for all `m`, i.e., `a (m + 1) - a m = d` for some fixed `d`.

But the recurrence is `a (m + 1) - a m = a (m + 2) - a (m + 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * (a (m + 1) - a m) = a (m + 2) - a m`.

This is a non-linear recurrence, and it is not straightforward to find a general solution. 

#### Step 3: Find a General Solution
Assume that the sequence is quadratic in `m`, i.e., `a m = A * m^2 + B * m + C`.

Substitute this into the recurrence:
`a (m + 1) - a m = A * (2 * m + 1) + B`
`a (m + 2) - a (m + 1) = A * (2 * m + 3) + B`

The recurrence becomes:
`A * (2 * m + 1) + B = A * (2 * m + 3) + B`

This simplifies to `0 = 2 * A`, so `A = 0`.

Thus, the sequence is linear: `a m = B * m + C`.

Substitute this into the given conditions:
1. `a 1 = 2 * x - 3` → `B * 1 + C = 2 * x - 3` → `B + C = 2 * x - 3`.
2. `a 2 = 5 * x - 11` → `B * 2 + C = 5 * x - 11` → `2 * B + C = 5 * x - 11`.
3. `a 3 = 3 * x + 1` → `B * 3 + C = 3 * x + 1` → `3 * B + C = 3 * x + 1`.

Now, we have three equations:
1. `B + C = 2 * x - 3`
2. `2 * B + C = 5 * x - 11`
3. `3 * B + C = 3 * x + 1`

Subtract the first equation from the second:
`(2 * B + C) - (B + C) = (5 * x - 11) - (2 * x - 3)`
`B = 3 * x - 8`

Subtract the second equation from the third:
`(3 * B + C) - (2 * B + C) = (3 * x + 1) - (5 * x - 11)`
`B = -2 * x + 12`

Set the two expressions for `B` equal to each other:
`3 * x - 8 = -2 * x + 12`
`5 * x = 20`
`x = 4`

Substitute `x = 4` back into `B = 3 * x - 8`:
`B = 12 - 8 = 4`

Substitute `B = 4` into `B + C = 2 * x - 3`:
`4 + C = 8 - 3 = 5`
`C = 1`

Thus, the sequence is `a m = 4 * m + 1`.

#### Step 4: Find `n` Such That `a n = 2009`
We have `a n = 4 * n + 1 = 2009`.

Solve for `n`:
`4 * n = 2008`
`n = 2008 / 4 = 502`

Thus, `n = 502`.

### Step 5: Abstract Plan
1. Assume the sequence is linear: `a m = B * m + C`.
2. Use the given conditions to find `B` and `C`:
   - `B + C = 2 * x - 3`
   - `2 * B + C = 5 * x - 11`
   - `3 * B + C = 3 * x + 1`
3. Solve the system of equations to find `B = 4`, `C = 1`, and `x = 4`.
4. Find `n` such that `a n = 2009`:
   - `4 * n + 1 = 2009` → `n = 502`.
