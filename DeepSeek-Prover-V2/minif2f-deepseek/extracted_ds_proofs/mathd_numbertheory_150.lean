### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( 7 + 30n \) is not a prime number. We are to show that \( n = 6 \) is the smallest such number. 

#### Step 1: Understand the condition
A number is not prime if it is either:
1. \( 1 \), or
2. \( 0 \), or
3. divisible by some other number other than \( 1 \) and itself.

For \( 7 + 30n \), we can check small values of \( n \) to see when it is not prime.

#### Step 2: Check small values of \( n \)

1. \( n = 1 \):
   \[ 7 + 30 \times 1 = 37 \]
   \( 37 \) is a prime number.

2. \( n = 2 \):
   \[ 7 + 30 \times 2 = 67 \]
   \( 67 \) is a prime number.

3. \( n = 3 \):
   \[ 7 + 30 \times 3 = 97 \]
   \( 97 \) is a prime number.

4. \( n = 4 \):
   \[ 7 + 30 \times 4 = 127 \]
   \( 127 \) is a prime number.

5. \( n = 5 \):
   \[ 7 + 30 \times 5 = 157 \]
   \( 157 \) is a prime number.

6. \( n = 6 \):
   \[ 7 + 30 \times 6 = 187 \]
   \( 187 = 11 \times 17 \), so it is not a prime number.

Thus, the smallest \( n \) is \( 6 \).

#### Step 3: Prove that \( n \geq 6 \)

Assume for contradiction that \( n \leq 5 \). Then \( n \) is one of \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \). For each of these \( n \), \( 7 + 30n \) is a prime number, as verified above. This contradicts the assumption that \( 7 + 30n \) is not a prime number. Hence, \( n \geq 6 \).

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the condition**: A number is not prime if it is not one of the following: \( 1 \), \( 0 \), or divisible by some other number other than \( 1 \) and itself.

2. **Check small values of \( n \)**:
   - For \( n = 1 \) to \( n = 5 \), compute \( 7 + 30n \) and verify that it is a prime number.
   - For \( n = 6 \), compute \( 7 + 30n = 187 \) and verify that it is not a prime number.

3. **Conclude the smallest \( n \)**: The smallest \( n \) for which \( 7 + 30n \) is not a prime number is \( 6 \).

4. **Prove \( n \geq 6 \)**:
   - Assume \( n \leq 5 \).
   - For each \( n \leq 5 \), \( 7 + 30n \) is a prime number.
   - This contradicts the assumption that \( 7 + 30n \) is not a prime number.
   - Hence, \( n \geq 6 \).
