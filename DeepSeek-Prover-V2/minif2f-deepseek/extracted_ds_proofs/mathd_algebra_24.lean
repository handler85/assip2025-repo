### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given the equation `x / 50 = 40` and need to prove that `x = 2000`. 

**Approach:**
To solve for `x`, we can multiply both sides of the equation by `50` to eliminate the denominator. This is a straightforward algebraic manipulation.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{50} = 40
   \]
2. Multiply both sides by `50` to isolate `x`:
   \[
   \frac{x}{50} \cdot 50 = 40 \cdot 50
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   x = 40 \cdot 50
   \]
3. Calculate the right side:
   \[
   40 \cdot 50 = 2000
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   x = 2000
   \]

**Verification:**
Substitute `x = 2000` back into the original equation to ensure correctness:
\[
\frac{2000}{50} = 40
\]
\[
40 = 40
\]
This confirms that the solution is correct.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Multiply both sides of the equation `x / 50 = 40` by `50` to eliminate the denominator.**
   - This gives `x = 40 * 50`.

2. **Calculate `40 * 50` to find the value of `x`.**
   - `40 * 50 = 2000`.

3. **Conclude that `x = 2000`.**

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements
