### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We need to find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), the following hold:
1. \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 3) = 1 \),
2. \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 2) = 1 \),
3. \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 1) = 1 \).

However, the Lean 4 statement is slightly different: it assumes that for all \( n \), the above three conditions hold, and asks us to prove that \( k \geq 5 \). 

But wait, this seems too strong because the conditions are vacuously true for \( n = 0 \), but \( n \) is a positive integer in the Lean 4 statement. 

But no, the Lean 4 statement is:
```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_435
  (k : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 0 < k)
  (h₁ : ∀ n, Nat.gcd (6 * n + k) (6 * n + 3) = 1)
  (h₂ : ∀ n, Nat.gcd (6 * n + k) (6 * n + 2) = 1)
  (h₃ : ∀ n, Nat.gcd (6 * n + k) (6 * n + 1) = 1) :
  5 ≤ k := by
```

This means that for all \( n \geq 0 \), the three conditions must hold. 

But the conditions are vacuously true for \( n = 0 \), because:
1. \( \gcd(k, 3) = 1 \),
2. \( \gcd(k, 2) = 1 \),
3. \( \gcd(k, 1) = 1 \).

But the third condition is always true, and the first two are only true if \( \gcd(k, 3) = 1 \) and \( \gcd(k, 2) = 1 \). 

But \( \gcd(k, 2) = 1 \) is equivalent to \( k \) being odd. 

Similarly, \( \gcd(k, 3) = 1 \) is equivalent to \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \). 

Thus, the conditions are equivalent to:
1. \( k \) is odd,
2. \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \).

But the problem is that the Lean 4 statement is not correctly representing the original problem. 

The original problem is to find the smallest \( k \) such that for every \( n \geq 1 \), the three conditions hold. 

But in Lean, the statement is for all \( n \geq 0 \), and \( k \) is a positive integer. 

But the conditions are vacuously true for \( n = 0 \), so the Lean statement is equivalent to:
1. \( \gcd(k, 3) = 1 \),
2. \( \gcd(k, 2) = 1 \),
3. \( \gcd(k, 1) = 1 \).

But the third condition is always true, and the first two are:
1. \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \),
2. \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 2 \).

Thus, the conditions are equivalent to:
1. \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \),
2. \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 2 \).

But \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 2 \) is equivalent to \( k \) being odd, and \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \) is equivalent to \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \). 

Thus, the conditions are equivalent to:
1. \( k \) is odd,
2. \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \).

But the smallest such \( k \) is \( 5 \), because:
- \( 5 \) is odd and \( 5 \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \),
- \( 3 \) is not odd,
- \( 1 \) is not odd,
- \( 2 \) is even,
- \( 4 \) is even,
- \( 6 \) is even,
- \( 7 \) is odd and \( 7 \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \),
- etc.

Thus, the smallest \( k \) satisfying the conditions is \( 5 \).

### Step 1: Prove that \( k \) is odd.

Assume for contradiction that \( k \) is even. Then \( k \equiv 0 \mod 2 \). Take \( n = 0 \). Then:
\[ \gcd(6 \cdot 0 + k, 6 \cdot 0 + 2) = \gcd(k, 2) = 2, \]
since \( k \) is even. But \( h_2 \) requires \( \gcd(6 \cdot 0 + k, 6 \cdot 0 + 2) = 1 \), which is a contradiction. Hence, \( k \) must be odd.

### Step 2: Prove that \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \).

Assume for contradiction that \( k \equiv 0 \mod 3 \). Then \( k \equiv 0 \mod 3 \). Take \( n = 0 \). Then:
\[ \gcd(6 \cdot 0 + k, 6 \cdot 0 + 3) = \gcd(k, 3) = 3, \]
since \( k \equiv 0 \mod 3 \). But \( h_1 \) requires \( \gcd(6 \cdot 0 + k, 6 \cdot 0 + 3) = 1 \), which is a contradiction. Hence, \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \).

### Step 3: Prove that \( k \geq 5 \).

We have already shown that \( k \) is odd and \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \). The smallest such \( k \) is \( 5 \), as verified by checking the numbers \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots \).

### Abstract Plan

1. **Prove \( k \) is odd**:
   - Assume \( k \) is even.
   - Take \( n = 0 \).
   - Derive a contradiction using \( h_2 \).

2. **Prove \( k \not\equiv 0 \mod 3 \)**:
   - Assume \( k \equiv 0 \mod 3 \).
   - Take \( n = 0 \).
   - Derive a contradiction using \( h_1 \).

3. **Prove \( k \geq 5 \)**:
   - Use the previous two results to find the smallest \( k \) satisfying the conditions.
