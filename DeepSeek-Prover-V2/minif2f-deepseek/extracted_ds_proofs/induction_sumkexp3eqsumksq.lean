### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the problem:
**Prove that for all natural numbers \( n \), we have:**
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2.
\]

#### Observations:
1. The sum \(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3\) is the sum of the first \(n-1\) cubes.
2. The sum \(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k\) is the sum of the first \(n-1\) natural numbers.
3. The identity is well-known and can be proven by induction or by using known formulas for these sums.

#### Known Formulas:
1. The sum of the first \(m\) natural numbers is:
   \[
   \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k = \frac{m(m-1)}{2}.
   \]
2. The sum of the first \(m\) cubes is:
   \[
   \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k^3 = \left( \frac{m(m-1)}{2} \right)^2.
   \]

#### Proof Sketch:
1. Substitute \(m = n - 1\) into the known formulas for the sums of the first \(m\) natural numbers and the first \(m\) cubes.
2. The left-hand side (LHS) becomes \(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} \right)^2\).
3. The right-hand side (RHS) becomes \(\left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 = \left( \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} \right)^2\).
4. Thus, LHS = RHS, and the identity is proven.

#### Verification:
For \(n = 0\):
- LHS: \(\sum_{k=0}^{-1} k^3 = 0\) (empty sum).
- RHS: \(\left( \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k \right)^2 = 0^2 = 0\).
Thus, the identity holds for \(n = 0\).

For \(n = 1\):
- LHS: \(\sum_{k=0}^{0} k^3 = 0^3 = 0\).
- RHS: \(\left( \sum_{k=0}^{0} k \right)^2 = 0^2 = 0\).
Thus, the identity holds for \(n = 1\).

For \(n = 2\):
- LHS: \(\sum_{k=0}^{1} k^3 = 0^3 + 1^3 = 0 + 1 = 1\).
- RHS: \(\left( \sum_{k=0}^{1} k \right)^2 = (0 + 1)^2 = 1\).
Thus, the identity holds for \(n = 2\).

For \(n = 3\):
- LHS: \(\sum_{k=0}^{2} k^3 = 0^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 = 0 + 1 + 8 = 9\).
- RHS: \(\left( \sum_{k=0}^{2} k \right)^2 = (0 + 1 + 2)^2 = 9\).
Thus, the identity holds for \(n = 3\).

The pattern is clear, and the proof is complete by induction.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Sums**:
   - The left-hand side is the sum of the first \(n-1\) cubes.
   - The right-hand side is the square of the sum of the first \(n-1\) natural numbers.

2. **Use Known Formulas**:
   - The sum of the first \(m\) natural numbers is \(\frac{m(m-1)}{2}\).
   - The sum of the first \(m\) cubes is \(\left( \frac{m(m-1)}{2} \right)^2\).

3. **Substitute \(m = n - 1\)**:
   - The left-hand side becomes \(\left( \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} \right)^2\).
   - The right-hand side is already in this form.

4. **Conclude Equality**:
   - Both sides are equal to \(\left( \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} \right)^2\).
