/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the roots of the two equations:
1. \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \)
2. \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \)

#### Step 1: Find the roots of \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \)
The roots of \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) are the cube roots of 8. The cube roots of 8 are:
\[ 2, \quad 2 \omega, \quad 2 \omega^2 \]
where \( \omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} \) is a primitive cube root of unity.

#### Step 2: Find the roots of \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \)
This is a quartic equation. We can try to factor it. Notice that \( z = 8 \) is a root:
\[ 8^3 - 8 \cdot 8^2 - 8 \cdot 8 + 64 = 512 - 512 - 64 + 64 = 0 \]
Thus, \( (z - 8) \) is a factor. Perform polynomial division or factor:
\[ z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = (z - 8)(z^2 - 8) \]
The roots are:
\[ z = 8, \quad z = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}, \quad z = -\sqrt{8} = -2\sqrt{2} \]

#### Step 3: Find the maximum distance between the roots
The roots of the first equation are \( 2, 2\omega, 2\omega^2 \). The roots of the second equation are \( 8, 2\sqrt{2}, -2\sqrt{2} \).

The maximum distance is between \( 2\omega^2 \) and \( 8 \), or between \( 2\omega \) and \( 2\sqrt{2} \).

Compute \( |2\omega^2 - 8| \):
\[ 2\omega^2 = 2 e^{4\pi i / 3} = 2 (\cos(4\pi/3) + i \sin(4\pi/3)) = 2 (-\cos(\pi/3) - i \sin(\pi/3)) = 2 (-1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2) = -1 - i \sqrt{3} \]
\[ |2\omega^2 - 8| = | -1 - i \sqrt{3} - 8 | = | -9 - i \sqrt{3} | = \sqrt{ (-9)^2 + (-\sqrt{3})^2 } = \sqrt{81 + 3} = \sqrt{84} = 2 \sqrt{21} \]

This is the maximum distance.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Find the roots of \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \)**:
   - The roots are \( 2, 2\omega, 2\omega^2 \), where \( \omega \) is a primitive cube root of unity.

2. **Find the roots of \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \)**:
   - Factor as \( (z - 8)(z^2 - 8) \).
   - The roots are \( 8, 2\sqrt{2}, -2\sqrt{2} \).

3. **Find the maximum distance between the roots**:
   - The maximum distance is \( |2\omega^2 - 8| = 2 \sqrt{21} \).
