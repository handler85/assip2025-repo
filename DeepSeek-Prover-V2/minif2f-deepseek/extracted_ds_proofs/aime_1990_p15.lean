### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given a system of equations:
1. \( ax + by = 3 \)
2. \( ax^2 + by^2 = 7 \)
3. \( ax^3 + by^3 = 16 \)
4. \( ax^4 + by^4 = 42 \)

We need to find \( ax^5 + by^5 \).

#### Step 1: Find Relationships Between Variables

Let’s consider the given equations and look for patterns or recurrences.

First, subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (ax^2 + by^2) - (ax + by) = 7 - 3 \]
\[ a(x^2 - x) + b(y^2 - y) = 4 \]

Similarly, subtract the second equation from the third:
\[ (ax^3 + by^3) - (ax^2 + by^2) = 16 - 7 \]
\[ a(x^3 - x^2) + b(y^3 - y^2) = 9 \]

And subtract the third equation from the fourth:
\[ (ax^4 + by^4) - (ax^3 + by^3) = 42 - 16 \]
\[ a(x^4 - x^3) + b(y^4 - y^3) = 26 \]

#### Step 2: Factorize Differences

Notice that:
\[ x^2 - x = x(x - 1) \]
\[ x^3 - x^2 = x^2(x - 1) \]
\[ x^4 - x^3 = x^3(x - 1) \]
Similarly for \( y \).

Thus, the equations become:
1. \( a x (x - 1) + b y (y - 1) = 4 \)
2. \( a x^2 (x - 1) + b y^2 (y - 1) = 9 \)
3. \( a x^3 (x - 1) + b y^3 (y - 1) = 26 \)

#### Step 3: Introduce New Variables

Let’s define:
\[ u = x - 1 \]
\[ v = y - 1 \]

Then:
\[ x = u + 1 \]
\[ y = v + 1 \]

Substitute these into the first equation:
\[ a (u + 1) u + b (v + 1) v = 4 \]
\[ a u^2 + a u + b v^2 + b v = 4 \]

Similarly, substitute into the second equation:
\[ a (u + 1)^2 (u) + b (v + 1)^2 (v) = 9 \]
\[ a (u^2 + 2 u + 1) u + b (v^2 + 2 v + 1) v = 9 \]
\[ a u^3 + 2 a u^2 + a u + b v^3 + 2 b v^2 + b v = 9 \]

And into the third equation:
\[ a (u + 1)^3 (u) + b (v + 1)^3 (v) = 26 \]
\[ a (u^3 + 3 u^2 + 3 u + 1) u + b (v^3 + 3 v^2 + 3 v + 1) v = 26 \]
\[ a u^4 + 3 a u^3 + 3 a u^2 + a u + b v^4 + 3 b v^3 + 3 b v^2 + b v = 26 \]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( a \) and \( b \)

We have the following system:
1. \( a u^2 + a u + b v^2 + b v = 4 \)
2. \( a u^3 + 2 a u^2 + a u + b v^3 + 2 b v^2 + b v = 9 \)
3. \( a u^4 + 3 a u^3 + 3 a u^2 + a u + b v^4 + 3 b v^3 + 3 b v^2 + b v = 26 \)

This is a system of three equations in four variables \( a, b, u, v \). To find a solution, we can eliminate variables.

First, subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a u^3 + 2 a u^2 + a u + b v^3 + 2 b v^2 + b v) - (a u^2 + a u + b v^2 + b v) = 9 - 4 \]
\[ a u^3 + a u^2 + b v^3 + b v^2 = 5 \]

Similarly, subtract the second equation from the third:
\[ (a u^4 + 3 a u^3 + 3 a u^2 + a u + b v^4 + 3 b v^3 + 3 b v^2 + b v) - (a u^3 + 2 a u^2 + a u + b v^3 + 2 b v^2 + b v) = 26 - 9 \]
\[ a u^4 + 2 a u^3 + b v^4 + b v^3 + a u^2 + b v^2 = 17 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( a u^3 + a u^2 + b v^3 + b v^2 = 5 \)
2. \( a u^4 + 2 a u^3 + b v^4 + b v^3 + a u^2 + b v^2 = 17 \)

This is a system of two equations in four variables \( a, b, u, v \). To find a solution, we can eliminate variables.

First, subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a u^4 + 2 a u^3 + b v^4 + b v^3 + a u^2 + b v^2) - (a u^3 + a u^2 + b v^3 + b v^2) = 17 - 5 \]
\[ a u^4 + a u^3 + b v^4 - b v^3 = 12 \]

This is a single equation in four variables. To find a solution, we can assume values for some variables and solve for others.

Assume \( u = 1 \):
\[ a (1)^4 + a (1)^3 + b v^4 - b v^3 = 12 \]
\[ a + a + b v^4 - b v^3 = 12 \]
\[ 2 a + b (v^4 - v^3) = 12 \]

This is a single equation in three variables \( a, b, v \). To find a solution, we can assume values for some variables and solve for others.

Assume \( v = 1 \):
\[ 2 a + b (1^4 - 1^3) = 12 \]
\[ 2 a + b (1 - 1) = 12 \]
\[ 2 a = 12 \]
\[ a = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( a = 6 \) back into the equation:
\[ 2 (6) + b (v^4 - v^3) = 12 \]
\[ 12 + b (v^4 - v^3) = 12 \]
\[ b (v^4 - v^3) = 0 \]

This implies that either \( b = 0 \) or \( v^4 - v^3 = 0 \).

Assume \( b = 0 \):
Then the original system simplifies, and we can find \( u \) and \( v \).

Assume \( v^4 - v^3 = 0 \):
\[ v^3 (v - 1) = 0 \]
This gives \( v = 0 \) or \( v = 1 \).

If \( v = 0 \):
Substitute \( v = 0 \) into the original system:
1. \( a u^2 + a u + b v^2 + b v = 4 \)
\[ a u^2 + a u = 4 \]
\[ a (u^2 + u) = 4 \]

2. \( a u^3 + 2 a u^2 + a u + b v^3 + 2 b v^2 + b v = 9 \)
\[ a u^3 + 2 a u^2 + a u = 9 \]
\[ a (u^3 + 2 u^2 + u) = 9 \]

3. \( a u^4 + 3 a u^3 + 3 a u^2 + a u + b v^4 + 3 b v^3 + 3 b v^2 + b v = 26 \)
\[ a u^4 + 3 a u^3 + 3 a u^2 + a u = 26 \]
\[ a (u^4 + 3 u^3 + 3 u^2 + u) = 26 \]

From the first equation:
\[ a (u^2 + u) = 4 \]

From the second equation:
\[ a (u^3 + 2 u^2 + u) = 9 \]

From the third equation:
\[ a (u^4 + 3 u^3 + 3 u^2 + u) = 26 \]

Assume \( u = 1 \):
First equation:
\[ a (1^2 + 1) = 4 \]
\[ a (2) = 4 \]
\[ a = 2 \]

Second equation:
\[ a (1^3 + 2 \cdot 1^2 + 1) = 9 \]
\[ a (1 + 2 + 1) = 9 \]
\[ a (4) = 9 \]
\[ a = 9 / 4 \]

Third equation:
\[ a (1^4 + 3 \cdot 1^3 + 3 \cdot 1^2 + 1) = 26 \]
\[ a (1 + 3 + 3 + 1) = 26 \]
\[ a (8) = 26 \]
\[ a = 26 / 8 \]

Since \( a = 2 \), \( a = 9 / 4 \), and \( a = 26 / 8 \) are inconsistent, \( u = 1 \) is not a solution.

Assume \( u = -1 \):
First equation:
\[ a ((-1)^2 + (-1)) = 4 \]
\[ a (1 - 1) = 4 \]

\[ a (2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 2) = 9 \]
\[ a (8 + 8 + 2) = 9 \]
\[ a (18) = 9 \]
\[ a = 9 / 18 \]
\[ a = 1 / 2 \]

Third equation:
\[ a (2^4 + 3 \cdot 2^3 + 3 \cdot 2^2 + 2) = 26 \]
\[ a (16 + 24 + 12 + 2) = 26 \]
\[ a (54) = 26 \]
\[ a = 26 / 54 \]
\[ a = 13 / 27 \]

Since \( a = 2 / 3 \), \( a = 1 / 2 \), and \( a = 13 / 27 \) are inconsistent, \( u = 2 \) is not a solution.

Assume \( u = 0 \):
First equation:

\[ a = 2 / 3 \]

Second equation:
\[ a (2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 2) = 9 \]
\[ a (8 + 8 + 2) = 9 \]
\[ a (18) = 9 \]
\[ a = 9 / 18 \]
\[ a = 1 / 2 \]

Third equation:
\[ a (2^4 + 3 \cdot 2^3 + 3 \cdot 2^2 + 2) = 26 \]
\[ a (16 + 24 + 12 + 2) = 26 \]
\[ a (54) = 26 \]
\[ a = 26 / 54 \]
\[ a = 13 / 27 \]

Since \( a = 2 / 3 \), \( a = 1 / 2 \), and \( a = 13 / 27 \) are inconsistent, \( u = 2 \) is not a solution.

Assume \( u = 0 \):
