/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem. We have a system of linear equations in variables \(x, y, z\):
1. \(a_{0}x + a_{1}y + a_{2}z = 0\),
2. \(a_{3}x + a_{4}y + a_{5}z = 0\),
3. \(a_{6}x + a_{7}y + a_{8}z = 0\).

The coefficients \(a_i\) satisfy:
- \(a_0, a_4, a_8 > 0\),
- \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_5, a_6, a_7 < 0\),
- The sums of coefficients in each equation are positive:
  - \(a_0 + a_1 + a_2 > 0\),
  - \(a_3 + a_4 + a_5 > 0\),
  - \(a_6 + a_7 + a_8 > 0\).

We need to prove that the only solution is \(x = y = z = 0\).

#### Key Observations:
1. The system is homogeneous, so \((0, 0, 0)\) is always a solution.
2. The coefficients are structured in a way that allows us to use contradiction or elimination.
3. The positivity of the diagonal coefficients and the negativity of the off-diagonal coefficients in each equation will help us bound the variables.

#### Proof Sketch:
1. Assume for contradiction that \((x, y, z) \neq (0, 0, 0)\).
2. From the first equation \(a_0 x + a_1 y + a_2 z = 0\), we can express \(x\) in terms of \(y\) and \(z\) (or vice versa) if \(a_0 \neq 0\). But since \(a_0 > 0\) and \(a_1, a_2\) could be negative, this is not straightforward.
3. Instead, we can use the second and third equations to eliminate variables. For example, we can express \(x\) from the first equation and substitute into the second and third equations to get a system in \(y\) and \(z\).
4. Alternatively, we can use the positivity of the diagonal coefficients and the negativity of the off-diagonal coefficients to bound the variables. For example, from the first equation, since \(a_0 > 0\) and \(a_1, a_2 < 0\), we have \(a_0 x \geq - (a_1 y + a_2 z)\). But since \(a_0 + a_1 + a_2 > 0\), we can use this to bound \(x\).
5. A more systematic approach is to consider the determinant of the coefficient matrix. The determinant is:
   \[
   \begin{vmatrix}
   a_0 & a_1 & a_2 \\
   a_3 & a_4 & a_5 \\
   a_6 & a_7 & a_8
   \end{vmatrix}
   \]
   If this determinant is non-zero, the system has a unique solution. However, the problem does not provide any information about the determinant, so we cannot use this directly.
6. Instead, we can use the given conditions to show that the only solution is \((0, 0, 0)\). For example, from the first equation \(a_0 x + a_1 y + a_2 z = 0\), we can write:
   \[
   x = -\frac{a_1 y + a_2 z}{a_0}.
   \]
   Substitute this into the second equation \(a_3 x + a_4 y + a_5 z = 0\):
   \[
   a_3 \left( -\frac{a_1 y + a_2 z}{a_0} \right) + a_4 y + a_5 z = 0.
   \]
   Multiply through by \(a_0\):
   \[
   -a_3 (a_1 y + a_2 z) + a_0 a_4 y + a_0 a_5 z = 0.
   \]
   Rearrange:
   \[
   -a_3 a_1 y - a_3 a_2 z + a_0 a_4 y + a_0 a_5 z = 0.
   \]
   Group terms involving \(y\) and \(z\):
   \[
   (-a_3 a_1 + a_0 a_4) y + (-a_3 a_2 + a_0 a_5) z = 0.
   \]
   This is a linear combination of \(y\) and \(z\) equaling zero. The coefficients are:
   \[
   A = -a_3 a_1 + a_0 a_4, \quad B = -a_3 a_2 + a_0 a_5.
   \]
   We can write the equation as \(A y + B z = 0\).

7. Similarly, from the first equation, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\) and \(z\) and substitute into the third equation to get another linear combination of \(x\) and \(z\).

8. The key observation is that the coefficients \(A\) and \(B\) are related to the original coefficients and the given conditions. Specifically, we can use the fact that \(a_0, a_4, a_8 > 0\) and \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_5, a_6, a_7 < 0\) to bound \(A\) and \(B\).

9. For example, \(A = -a_3 a_1 + a_0 a_4 > 0\) because \(a_0, a_4 > 0\) and \(a_3, a_1 < 0\). Similarly, \(B = -a_3 a_2 + a_0 a_5 > 0\) because \(a_0, a_5 > 0\) and \(a_3, a_2 < 0\).

10. Thus, we have \(A y + B z = 0\) with \(A, B > 0\). This implies \(y = z = 0\).

11. Substituting \(y = z = 0\) back into the first equation \(a_0 x + a_1 y + a_2 z = 0\) gives \(a_0 x = 0\). Since \(a_0 > 0\), we have \(x = 0\).

12. Therefore, the only solution is \(x = y = z = 0\).

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Assume a Non-Zero Solution**:
   - Suppose \((x, y, z) \neq (0, 0, 0)\).

2. **Express \(x\) in Terms of \(y\) and \(z\)**:
   - From the first equation \(a_0 x + a_1 y + a_2 z = 0\), express \(x\) as \(x = -\frac{a_1 y + a_2 z}{a_0}\).

3. **Substitute into the Second Equation**:
   - Substitute \(x\) into the second equation \(a_3 x + a_4 y + a_5 z = 0\) to get a new equation involving \(y\) and \(z\).

4. **Simplify the New Equation**:
   - Multiply through by \(a_0\) to eliminate denominators and simplify to obtain a linear combination of \(y\) and \(z\) equaling zero.

5. **Repeat for the Third Equation**:
   - Similarly, express \(y\) in terms of \(x\) and \(z\) from the first equation and substitute into the third equation to get another linear combination of \(x\) and \(z\) equaling zero.

6. **Solve the System of Linear Equations**:
   - The two linear combinations of \(x\) and \(z\) and \(y\) and \(z\) respectively form a system of linear equations. Solve this system to find that \(x = y = z = 0\) is the only solution.
