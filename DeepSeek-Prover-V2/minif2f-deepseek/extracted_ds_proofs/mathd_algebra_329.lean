### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have two equations:
1. \( 3y = x \) (Equation 1)
2. \( 2x + 5y = 11 \) (Equation 2)

We need to find \( x + y \).

**Approach:**
First, substitute \( x \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2 to eliminate \( x \). This will give us an equation in terms of \( y \), which we can solve for \( y \). Then, substitute the value of \( y \) back into Equation 1 to find \( x \), and finally compute \( x + y \).

**Detailed Solution:**

1. From Equation 1, we have \( x = 3y \).

2. Substitute \( x = 3y \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2(3y) + 5y = 11 \implies 6y + 5y = 11 \implies 11y = 11.
   \]

3. Solve for \( y \):
   \[
   11y = 11 \implies y = 1.
   \]

4. Substitute \( y = 1 \) back into \( x = 3y \):
   \[
   x = 3 \cdot 1 = 3.
   \]

5. Compute \( x + y \):
   \[
   x + y = 3 + 1 = 4.
   \]

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the coordinates of point \( A \) is \( 4 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Substitute \( x \) in terms of \( y \):**
   - From \( 3y = x \), we get \( x = 3y \).

2. **Substitute \( x = 3y \) into the second equation:**
   - \( 2(3y) + 5y = 11 \) simplifies to \( 11y = 11 \).

3. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - \( 11y = 11 \) gives \( y = 1 \).

4. **Find \( x \) using \( y = 1 \):**
   - \( x = 3y = 3 \).

5. **Compute \( x + y \):**
   - \( x + y = 3 + 1 = 4 \).
