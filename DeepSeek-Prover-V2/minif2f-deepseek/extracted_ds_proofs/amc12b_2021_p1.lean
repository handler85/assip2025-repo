### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem correctly. We have a set `S` of integers `x` such that `|x| < 3 * π` (where `π` is the mathematical constant). We need to determine the cardinality of `S`.

#### Step 1: Understand the condition `|x| < 3 * π`

The condition `|x| < 3 * π` is equivalent to `-3 * π < x < 3 * π` because `|x| = x` if `x ≥ 0` and `|x| = -x` if `x ≤ 0`.

We need to find all integers `x` such that `-3 * π < x < 3 * π`.

#### Step 2: Find the range of `x`

First, find `3 * π`:
`π ≈ 3.1415926535...`
`3 * π ≈ 9.424777960769...`

Thus, `-3 * π ≈ -9.424777960769...`

The condition `-3 * π < x < 3 * π` is equivalent to `-9.424777960769... < x < 9.424777960769...`.

Since `x` is an integer, the possible values of `x` are all integers from `-9` to `9` inclusive.

#### Step 3: Count the number of integers

The integers from `-9` to `9` inclusive are:
`-9, -8, ..., 8, 9`

This is an arithmetic sequence with:
- First term `a_1 = -9`
- Last term `a_n = 9`
- Common difference `d = 1`
- Number of terms `n = 19`

Alternatively, the number of integers from `-9` to `9` is `9 - (-9) + 1 = 19`.

#### Step 4: Verify the condition

For `x = 9`:
`|9| = 9 < 3 * π ≈ 9.424777960769...` ✅

For `x = -9`:
`|-9| = 9 < 3 * π ≈ 9.424777960769...` ✅

For `x = 0`:
`|0| = 0 < 3 * π ≈ 9.424777960769...` ✅

For `x = 10`:
`|10| = 10 ≮ 3 * π ≈ 9.424777960769...` ❌

Thus, all integers `x` in `-9` to `9` satisfy `|x| < 3 * π`, and no other integers do.

#### Step 5: Formalize the condition

The set `S` is defined as:
`S = {x ∈ ℤ | |x| < 3 * π}`

We need to find the cardinality of `S`.

#### Step 6: Prove the cardinality is 19

We have already shown that `S` is the set of all integers `x` such that `-9 ≤ x ≤ 9`. The number of integers in this range is `19` (from `-9` to `9` inclusive).

### Step 7: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the condition `|x| < 3 * π`**:
   - This is equivalent to `-3 * π < x < 3 * π` because `|x| = x` if `x ≥ 0` and `|x| = -x` if `x ≤ 0`.

2. **Find the range of `x`**:
   - Calculate `3 * π ≈ 9.424777960769...`.
   - Thus, `-3 * π ≈ -9.424777960769...`.
   - The condition `-3 * π < x < 3 * π` is equivalent to `-9.424777960769... < x < 9.424777960769...`.

3. **Find all integers `x` in this range**:
   - The integers from `-9` to `9` inclusive are all integers `x` such that `-9 ≤ x ≤ 9`.

4. **Count the number of integers**:
   - The number of integers from `-9` to `9` is `19` (from `-9` to `9` inclusive).

5. **Verify the condition for all integers `x` in `-9` to `9`**:
   - For `x = 9`, `|9| = 9 < 3 * π ≈ 9.424777960769...` ✅.
   - For `x = -9`, `|-9| = 9 < 3 * π ≈ 9.424777960769...` ✅.
   - For `x = 0`, `|0| = 0 < 3 * π ≈ 9.424777960769...` ✅.
   - For `x = 10`, `|10| = 10 ≮ 3 * π ≈ 9.424777960769...` ❌.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The set `S` is exactly the set of all integers `x` such that `-9 ≤ x ≤ 9`, and its cardinality is `19`.

theorem amc12b_2021_p1
  (S : Finset ℤ)
  (h₀ : ∀ (x : ℤ), x ∈ S ↔ ↑(abs x) < 3 * Real.pi):
  S.card = 19 := by
  have h_main : S = { -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 } := by
    sorry
  have h_card : S.card = 19 := by
    sorry
  exact h_card
```

### Explanation

1. **`h_main`**: We first establish that `S` is exactly the set of all integers from `-9` to `9`. This is based on the condition `|x| < 3 * π` being equivalent to `-9 ≤ x ≤ 9` for `x ∈ ℤ`.

2. **`h_card`**: We then compute the cardinality of `S` to be `19` by observing that the set `{ -9, ..., 9 }` has `19` elements.

3. **Conclusion**: The final result `S.card = 19` follows directly from `h_card`.
