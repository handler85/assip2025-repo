### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem Analysis:**
We need to find a positive integer `m` such that:
1. `m > n` (for a given `n > 0`), and
2. There exists a positive integer `p` such that `m * p ≤ m + p`.

The second condition can be rewritten as `(m - 1) * p ≤ m` (by subtracting `p` from both sides). 

**Approach:**
1. Choose `m` such that `m > n`. A simple choice is `m = n + 1`.
2. We need to find `p` such that `(m - 1) * p ≤ m`.
   - For `m = n + 1`, `m - 1 = n`.
   - The condition becomes `n * p ≤ n + p`, i.e., `(n - 1) * p ≤ n`.
   - If `n = 1`, this is `0 * p ≤ 1`, which is true for any `p ≥ 1`.
   - If `n > 1`, we can choose `p = 1` to get `(n - 1) * 1 ≤ n`, i.e., `n - 1 ≤ n`, which is true.

But wait, the above is not quite correct. The original condition is `m * p ≤ m + p`, not `(m - 1) * p ≤ m`. 

Let me re-express the condition:
`m * p ≤ m + p` is equivalent to `(m - 1) * p ≤ m` (by subtracting `p` from both sides).

But `(m - 1) * p ≤ m` is not always true for `m > 1` and `p = 1`. For example, if `m = 2`, `(m - 1) * p = 1 ≤ 2` is true. If `m = 3`, `(m - 1) * p = 2 ≤ 3` is true. If `m = 4`, `(m - 1) * p = 3 ≤ 4` is true. 

But wait, `(m - 1) * p ≤ m` is equivalent to `m * p - p ≤ m`, i.e., `m * p ≤ m + p`, which is the original condition. 

Thus, the choice `m = n + 1` and `p = 1` works for all `n > 0`.

**Verification:**
1. `m = n + 1 > n` is true because `n > 0`.
2. `m * p = (n + 1) * 1 = n + 1`, and `m + p = n + 1 + 1 = n + 2`.
   - `m * p ≤ m + p` is `n + 1 ≤ n + 2`, which is true.

Thus, the solution is correct.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Choose `m = n + 1`**:
   - This ensures `m > n` because `n > 0`.

2. **Choose `p = 1`**:
   - Compute `m * p = n + 1` and `m + p = n + 2`.
   - Check `m * p ≤ m + p` is `n + 1 ≤ n + 2`, which is true.
