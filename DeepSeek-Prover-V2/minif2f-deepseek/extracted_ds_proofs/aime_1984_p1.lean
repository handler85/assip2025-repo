### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem and the given conditions.

1. **Sequence Definition**:
   - The sequence `u : ℕ → ℚ` is defined recursively by `u(n + 1) = u(n) + 1` for all `n ∈ ℕ`.
   - This means that the sequence is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of `1`.

2. **Sum Condition**:
   - The sum of the first `98` terms of the sequence `u(k + 1)` for `k` from `0` to `97` is `137`.
   - Note that `u(k + 1)` is the `(k + 1)`-th term of the sequence `u`, i.e., `u(1), u(2), ..., u(98)`.
   - The sum is `u(1) + u(2) + ... + u(98) = 137`.

3. **Goal**:
   - We need to find the sum `u(2) + u(4) + ... + u(98)`, i.e., the sum of the even-indexed terms of the sequence `u` from `u(2)` to `u(98)`.
   - The number of terms in this sum is `49` (from `u(2)` to `u(98)`).

#### Step 1: Understand the Sequence
The sequence `u` is defined recursively by `u(n + 1) = u(n) + 1` for all `n ∈ ℕ`. This means that:
- `u(1) = u(0) + 1`
- `u(2) = u(1) + 1 = u(0) + 2`
- ...
- `u(n) = u(0) + n` for all `n ∈ ℕ`.

#### Step 2: Rewrite the Sum Condition
The sum `u(1) + u(2) + ... + u(98)` is:
`(u(0) + 1) + (u(0) + 2) + ... + (u(0) + 98)`.

This is an arithmetic series with `98` terms, the first term `a = u(0) + 1`, and the last term `l = u(0) + 98`.

The sum of an arithmetic series is `S = n * (a + l) / 2`, where `n` is the number of terms.

Here, `S = 137`, `n = 98`, `a = u(0) + 1`, `l = u(0) + 98`.

So, `137 = 98 * (u(0) + 1 + u(0) + 98) / 2 = 98 * (2 * u(0) + 99) / 2 = 98 * (u(0) + 49.5)`.

But `98 * (u(0) + 49.5) = 98 * u(0) + 4851`.

So, `137 = 98 * u(0) + 4851`.

This gives `98 * u(0) = 137 - 4851 = -4714`.

Thus, `u(0) = -4714 / 98 = -2357 / 49`.

#### Step 3: Find the Sum of Even-Indexed Terms
The sum we need is `u(2) + u(4) + ... + u(98)`.

Using the general form `u(n) = u(0) + n`, we have:
`u(2) = u(0) + 2`,
`u(4) = u(0) + 4`,
...,
`u(98) = u(0) + 98`.

Thus, the sum is:
`(u(0) + 2) + (u(0) + 4) + ... + (u(0) + 98)`.

This is an arithmetic series with `49` terms, the first term `a = u(0) + 2`, and the last term `l = u(0) + 98`.

The sum of an arithmetic series is `S = n * (a + l) / 2`, where `n` is the number of terms.

Here, `S = 49 * (u(0) + 2 + u(0) + 98) / 2 = 49 * (2 * u(0) + 100) / 2 = 49 * (u(0) + 50)`.

Substitute `u(0) = -2357 / 49`:
`S = 49 * (-2357 / 49 + 50) = 49 * (-2357 / 49 + 2450 / 49) = 49 * (93 / 49) = 93`.

Thus, the sum is `93`.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Find the General Form of `u(n)`**:
   - Use the recurrence relation `u(n + 1) = u(n) + 1` to derive `u(n) = u(0) + n` for all `n ∈ ℕ`.

2. **Use the Sum Condition to Find `u(0)`**:
   - The sum `u(1) + u(2) + ... + u(98)` is `98 * (u(0) + 49.5) = 137`.
   - Solve for `u(0) = -2357 / 49`.

3. **Find the Sum of Even-Indexed Terms**:
   - The sum `u(2) + u(4) + ... + u(98)` is `49 * (u(0) + 50) = 93`.
