/- ### Detailed Proof

**Problem:** Evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) and show that it is \(-\frac{1}{4}\).

**Solution:**

1. Recall that \(i^2 = -1\) by the definition of the imaginary unit.
2. Compute \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) using the distributive property of exponents over multiplication:
   \[
   \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{i^2}{2^2} = \frac{-1}{4} = -\frac{1}{4}.
   \]

This completes the proof.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the square of the complex number \(\frac{i}{2}\).
   - The result should be \(-\frac{1}{4}\).

2. **Use the Definition of \(i\):**
   - Recall that \(i^2 = -1\).

3. **Apply the Exponent Rule:**
   - The square of a fraction is the square of the numerator divided by the square of the denominator.
   - Thus, \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{i^2}{2^2} = \frac{-1}{4}\).

4. **Final Result:**
   - The value is \(-\frac{1}{4}\).
