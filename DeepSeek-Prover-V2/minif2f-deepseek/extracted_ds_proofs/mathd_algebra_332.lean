/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) with the following conditions:
1. The arithmetic mean of \( x \) and \( y \) is 7, i.e., \(\frac{x + y}{2} = 7\).
2. The geometric mean of \( x \) and \( y \) is \(\sqrt{19}\), i.e., \(\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{19}\).

We need to find \( x^2 + y^2 \).

**Key Observations:**
1. The arithmetic mean is 7, so \( x + y = 14 \).
2. The geometric mean is \(\sqrt{19}\), so \( xy = 19 \) (since \(\sqrt{19} \geq 0\) and \(\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{19}\) implies \( xy \geq 0 \), but we don't need this here).
3. The identity \( (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \) can be rearranged to \( x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy \).

**Proof Sketch:**
1. From \(\frac{x + y}{2} = 7\), we get \( x + y = 14 \).
2. From \(\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{19}\), we get \( xy = 19 \) (since the square root is injective and \( xy \geq 0 \), but we don't need this here).
3. Substitute \( x + y = 14 \) and \( xy = 19 \) into \( x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy \) to get \( x^2 + y^2 = 14^2 - 2 \cdot 19 = 196 - 38 = 158 \).

**Verification of \( xy = 19 \):**
The condition \(\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{19}\) implies \( xy \geq 0 \) and \( xy = 19 \). This is because the square root function is injective on non-negative reals, and \( \sqrt{19} \geq 0 \).

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Step 1: Derive \( x + y = 14 \) from the arithmetic mean condition.**
   - Multiply both sides of \(\frac{x + y}{2} = 7\) by 2 to get \(x + y = 14\).

2. **Step 2: Derive \( xy = 19 \) from the geometric mean condition.**
   - Square both sides of \(\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{19}\) to get \(xy = 19\) (since \(\sqrt{xy} \geq 0\) and \(\sqrt{19} \geq 0\)).

3. **Step 3: Compute \( x^2 + y^2 \) using the identity \((x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2\).**
   - Substitute \(x + y = 14\) and \(xy = 19\) into the identity to get \(14^2 = x^2 + 2 \cdot 19 + y^2\).
   - Simplify to \(196 = x^2 + 38 + y^2\), then \(x^2 + y^2 = 158\).

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements
