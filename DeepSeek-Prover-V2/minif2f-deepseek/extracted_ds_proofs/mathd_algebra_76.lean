### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem and the function `f(n)`:
1. For odd `n`, `f(n) = n²`.
2. For even `n`, `f(n) = n² - 4n - 1`.

We are to compute `f(f(f(f(f(4))))))` and show that it is `1`.

#### Step 1: Compute `f(4)`
- `4` is even.
- `f(4) = 4² - 4*4 - 1 = 16 - 16 - 1 = -1`.

#### Step 2: Compute `f(f(4)) = f(-1)`
- `-1` is odd.
- `f(-1) = (-1)² = 1`.

#### Step 3: Compute `f(f(f(4))) = f(1)`
- `1` is odd.
- `f(1) = 1² = 1`.

#### Step 4: Compute `f(f(f(f(4)))) = f(1) = 1`
- `1` is odd.
- `f(1) = 1² = 1`.

#### Step 5: Compute `f(f(f(f(f(4))))) = f(1) = 1`
- `1` is odd.
- `f(1) = 1² = 1`.

Thus, the final answer is `1`.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Compute `f(4)`**:
   - `4` is even.
   - `f(4) = 4² - 4*4 - 1 = 16 - 16 - 1 = -1`.

2. **Compute `f(f(4)) = f(-1)`**:
   - `-1` is odd.
   - `f(-1) = (-1)² = 1`.

3. **Compute `f(f(f(4))) = f(1)`**:
   - `1` is odd.
   - `f(1) = 1² = 1`.

4. **Compute `f(f(f(f(4)))) = f(1) = 1`**:
   - `1` is odd.
   - `f(1) = 1² = 1`.

5. **Compute `f(f(f(f(f(4))))) = f(1) = 1`**:
   - `1` is odd.
   - `f(1) = 1² = 1`.
