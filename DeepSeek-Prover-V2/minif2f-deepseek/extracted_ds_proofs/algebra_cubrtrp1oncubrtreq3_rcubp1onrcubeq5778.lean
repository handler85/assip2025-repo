### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. The Lean 4 statement is:
```lean4
theorem algebra_cubrtrp1oncubrtreq3_rcubp1onrcubeq5778
  (r : ℝ)
  (h₀ : r^(1 / 3) + 1 / r^(1 / 3) = 3) :
  r^3 + 1 / r^3 = 5778 := by
  sorry
```

#### Observations:
1. The expression `r^(1 / 3)` is interpreted as `r^(0)` because `1 / 3` in Lean 4 is integer division, which evaluates to `0`. This is incorrect for real numbers, but Lean 4's `^` operator is overloaded for `ℝ` and `ℕ` (or `ℤ`).
   - However, in Lean 4, `r : ℝ` and `1 / 3 : ℕ` is coerced to `ℝ` (but `1 / 3` is `0` in `ℕ`). So `r^(1 / 3)` is `r^0 = 1` (assuming `r ≠ 0`).
   - But if `r = 0`, `r^(1 / 3)` is `0^0`, which is `1` in Lean 4 (but `0^0` is undefined in math).
   - But Lean 4's `^` for `ℝ` and `ℕ` is `x ^ n = if x = 0 then 0 else x ^ n` (but `0 ^ 0 = 1`).
   - So `r^(1 / 3) = r^0 = 1` (if `r ≠ 0`) or `0^0 = 1` (if `r = 0`).
   - Similarly, `1 / r^(1 / 3) = 1` (if `r ≠ 0`) or `1 / 0^0 = 1` (if `r = 0`).
   - Thus, `h₀` becomes `1 + 1 = 3` or `0 + 0 = 3` (but `0 + 0 = 0 ≠ 3`). So `h₀` is `2 = 3` (false) or `0 = 3` (false). Hence, the hypothesis `h₀` is false, and the implication is vacuously true.

But wait, Lean 4's `^` for `ℝ` and `ℕ` is `x ^ n = if x = 0 then 0 else x ^ n` (but `0 ^ 0 = 1`). So:
- If `r ≠ 0`, then `r^(1 / 3) = r^0 = 1` and `1 / r^(1 / 3) = 1`.
- If `r = 0`, then `r^(1 / 3) = 0^0 = 1` and `1 / r^(1 / 3) = 1 / 1 = 1`.
Thus, `h₀` simplifies to `1 + 1 = 3` or `2 = 3`, which is false. Therefore, the hypothesis `h₀` is impossible, and the conclusion `r^3 + 1 / r^3 = 5778` is vacuously true under `h₀`.

But Lean 4's `^` for `ℝ` and `ℕ` is `x ^ n = if x = 0 then 0 else x ^ n` (but `0 ^ 0 = 1`). So:
- If `r ≠ 0`, then `r^(1 / 3) = r^0 = 1` and `1 / r^(1 / 3) = 1`.
- If `r = 0`, then `r^(1 / 3) = 0^0 = 1` and `1 / r^(1 / 3) = 1 / 1 = 1`.
Thus, `h₀` simplifies to `1 + 1 = 3` or `2 = 3`, which is false. Therefore, the hypothesis `h₀` is impossible, and the conclusion `r^3 + 1 / r^3 = 5778` is vacuously true under `h₀`.

#### Step 1: Prove that `h₀` is False

1. Simplify `r^(1 / 3)`:
   - In Lean 4, `1 / 3` is `0` (integer division).
   - So `r^(1 / 3) = r^0 = 1` (for `r ≠ 0` or `r = 0`).

2. Simplify `1 / r^(1 / 3)`:
   - Similarly, `1 / r^(1 / 3) = 1` (for `r ≠ 0` or `r = 0`).

3. Thus, `h₀` simplifies to `1 + 1 = 3` or `2 = 3`, which is false.

#### Step 2: Conclusion

Since `h₀` is false, the implication `h₀ → r^3 + 1 / r^3 = 5778` is vacuously true.

### Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify `r^(1 / 3)`**:
   - `1 / 3` is `0` in integer division.
   - `r^(1 / 3) = r^0 = 1` for all `r`.

2. **Simplify `1 / r^(1 / 3)`**:
   - Similarly, `1 / r^(1 / 3) = 1` for all `r`.

3. **Substitute into `h₀`**:
   - `h₀` becomes `1 + 1 = 3` or `2 = 3`, which is false.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The implication is vacuously true because `h₀` is false.
