/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's restate the problem in a more familiar form. We are given positive integers \(a, b\) such that there exists a positive integer \(k\) satisfying:
\[ 2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2). \]
We need to prove that \(a = 1\).

#### Key Observations:
1. The right-hand side \((a + b^2)(b + a^2)\) is a product of two positive integers, and the left-hand side is a power of 2.
2. The product \((a + b^2)(b + a^2)\) must be a power of 2 because \(2^k\) is a power of 2.
3. The product \((a + b^2)(b + a^2)\) is even because \(a, b \geq 1\) and at least one of \(a + b^2\) or \(b + a^2\) is even (since one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even).
4. The product \((a + b^2)(b + a^2)\) must be a power of 2, so all its prime factors must be 2.
5. The product \((a + b^2)(b + a^2)\) is a product of two numbers, each of which is at least \(1 + 1 = 2\) (since \(a, b \geq 1\)).
6. The only way a product of two numbers, each at least 2, can be a power of 2 is if one of the numbers is 2 and the other is a power of 2.

#### Detailed Reasoning:
1. Assume for contradiction that \(a \geq 2\).
2. Then \(a + b^2 \geq 2 + 1 = 3\) (since \(b \geq 1\)) and \(b + a^2 \geq 1 + 4 = 5\) (since \(a \geq 2\)).
3. The product \((a + b^2)(b + a^2) \geq 3 \times 5 = 15\).
4. But \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2) \geq 15\) implies \(k \geq 4\) (since \(2^3 = 8 < 15 \leq 2^4 = 16\)).
5. However, \((a + b^2)(b + a^2) \geq 15\) is not a power of 2 for \(a \geq 2\) and \(b \geq 1\).
   - For example, if \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), \((a + b^2)(b + a^2) = (2 + 1)(1 + 4) = 3 \times 5 = 15\) is not a power of 2.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), \((a + b^2)(b + a^2) = (2 + 4)(2 + 4) = 6 \times 6 = 36\) is not a power of 2.
   - If \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\), \((a + b^2)(b + a^2) = (3 + 1)(1 + 9) = 4 \times 10 = 40\) is not a power of 2.
   - The only possible case is \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), but \((1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 = 2^2\) is a power of 2.
6. Therefore, the only solution is \(a = 1\).

#### Abstract Plan:
1. Assume \(a \geq 2\) and derive a contradiction.
   - Show that \((a + b^2)(b + a^2) \geq 15\) for \(a \geq 2\) and \(b \geq 1\).
   - Show that no power of 2 is \(\geq 15\) and \(\leq 16\) except \(16\) itself.
   - Check that \((a + b^2)(b + a^2) \neq 16\) for \(a \geq 2\) and \(b \geq 1\).
2. Conclude that \(a = 1\) is the only solution.
