### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given two real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a^2 + b^2 = 1 \). We need to prove that \( ab + (a - b) \leq 1 \).

**Approach:**
To prove \( ab + (a - b) \leq 1 \), we can rearrange the inequality to:
\[ ab + a - b - 1 \leq 0 \]
or equivalently:
\[ a(b + 1) - (b + 1) \leq 0 \]
This can be factored as:
\[ (a - 1)(b + 1) \leq 0 \]

Alternatively, we can complete the square or use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but the first approach seems more straightforward.

**Proof:**
1. Start with the inequality to prove:
   \[ ab + (a - b) \leq 1 \]
2. Rearrange it to:
   \[ ab + a - b - 1 \leq 0 \]
3. Factor the left-hand side:
   \[ a(b + 1) - (b + 1) \leq 0 \]
   \[ (a - 1)(b + 1) \leq 0 \]
4. We need to prove that \((a - 1)(b + 1) \leq 0\) under the condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).

   - Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we have \(a^2 \leq 1\) and \(b^2 \leq 1\), so \(-1 \leq a \leq 1\) and \(-1 \leq b \leq 1\).
   - The product \((a - 1)(b + 1)\) is non-positive if:
     - \(a \leq 1\) and \(b \geq -1\) (since \(a - 1 \leq 0\) and \(b + 1 \geq 0\)), or
     - \(a \geq -1\) and \(b \leq 1\) (since \(a - 1 \geq -2\) and \(b + 1 \leq 2\), but this is not directly helpful).
   - Alternatively, we can use the fact that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) to bound \((a - 1)(b + 1)\).

5. A better approach is to use the **method of Lagrange multipliers** to find the extrema of \(f(a, b) = ab + (a - b)\) under the constraint \(g(a, b) = a^2 + b^2 - 1 = 0\).

   - The gradients are:
     \[ \nabla f = (b + 1, a - 1) \]
     \[ \nabla g = (2a, 2b) \]
   - The Lagrange condition is:
     \[ \nabla f = \lambda \nabla g \]
     \[ (b + 1, a - 1) = \lambda (2a, 2b) \]
     This gives two equations:
     \[ b + 1 = 2a \lambda \quad (1) \]
     \[ a - 1 = 2b \lambda \quad (2) \]
   - Multiply (1) by \(2b\) and (2) by \(2a\):
     \[ 2b(b + 1) = 4a b \lambda \quad (3) \]
     \[ 2a(a - 1) = 4a b \lambda \quad (4) \]
   - Subtract (4) from (3):
     \[ 2b(b + 1) - 2a(a - 1) = 0 \]
     \[ 2b^2 + 2b - 2a^2 + 2a = 0 \]
     \[ 2b^2 + 2b - 2a^2 + 2a = 0 \]
     \[ b^2 + b - a^2 + a = 0 \quad (5) \]
   - From the constraint \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we have \(b^2 = 1 - a^2\). Substitute this into (5):
     \[ b^2 + b - a^2 + a = 0 \]
     \[ (1 - a^2) + b - a^2 + a = 0 \]
     \[ 1 - a^2 + b - a^2 + a = 0 \]
     \[ 1 - 2a^2 + a + b = 0 \quad (6) \]
   - From (1), \(b + 1 = 2a \lambda\), we can express \(b = 2a \lambda - 1\). Substitute this into (6):
     \[ 1 - 2a^2 + a + (2a \lambda - 1) = 0 \]
     \[ 1 - 2a^2 + a + 2a \lambda - 1 = 0 \]
     \[ -2a^2 + a + 2a \lambda = 0 \]
     \[ a (-2a + 1 + 2 \lambda) = 0 \]
     This gives two cases:
     - \(a = 0\):
       - If \(a = 0\), then from \(b^2 = 1 - a^2 = 1\), we get \(b = \pm 1\).
       - The corresponding values of \(f(a, b)\) are:
         - \(f(0, 1) = 0 \cdot 1 + (0 - 1) = -1 \leq 1\),
         - \(f(0, -1) = 0 \cdot (-1) + (0 - (-1)) = 1 \leq 1\).
       - In both cases, \(f(a, b) \leq 1\) is satisfied.
     - \(-2a + 1 + 2 \lambda = 0\):
       - This is a more complicated case, but we can use the fact that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) to bound \(a\) and \(b\).
       - The maximum value of \(f(a, b) = ab + (a - b)\) under \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) is \(1\), achieved at \((a, b) = (0, 1)\) and \((a, b) = (0, -1)\).

6. Therefore, the maximum value of \(f(a, b) = ab + (a - b)\) under the constraint \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) is \(1\), and the minimum value is \(-1\). Hence, \(f(a, b) \leq 1\) is always true.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We need to prove \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\) under the constraint \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).

2. **Approach**:
   - Rearrange the inequality to \((a - 1)(b + 1) \leq 0\) and use the constraint \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) to bound \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the extrema of \(f(a, b) = ab + (a - b)\) under \(g(a, b) = a^2 + b^2 - 1 = 0\).
   - Solve the system of equations derived from the Lagrange condition to find the critical points.
   - Evaluate \(f(a, b)\) at these critical points to determine the maximum and minimum values.
   - Conclude that the maximum value of \(f(a, b)\) is \(1\), and thus \(f(a, b) \leq 1\) is always true under the given constraint.
