/- ### Detailed Proof

**Problem:** Prove that \(\frac{\log 27}{\log 3} = 3\).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the logarithm:**
   - The logarithm \(\log_b a\) is the exponent to which \(b\) must be raised to obtain \(a\).
   - The change of base formula is \(\log_b a = \frac{\log_k a}{\log_k b}\) for any positive \(k \neq 1\).

2. **Apply the change of base formula:**
   - Here, we use the natural logarithm (base \(e\)) for simplicity, but any base would work.
   - The given expression is \(\frac{\log 27}{\log 3}\).
   - We can rewrite \(27\) as \(3^3\), so \(\log 27 = \log (3^3) = 3 \log 3\).
   - Substitute this into the original expression:
     \[
     \frac{\log 27}{\log 3} = \frac{3 \log 3}{\log 3} = 3.
     \]

3. **Verification:**
   - The simplification is valid because \(\log 3 \neq 0\) (since \(3 > 1\) and \(\log 1 = 0\), and \(\log 3 > \log 1 = 0\)).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the goal:**
   - We need to prove that \(\frac{\log 27}{\log 3} = 3\).

2. **Simplify the numerator:**
   - Recognize that \(27 = 3^3\).
   - Use the logarithm power rule: \(\log (3^3) = 3 \log 3\).

3. **Substitute and simplify:**
   - Substitute the simplified numerator into the original fraction:
     \[
     \frac{\log 27}{\log 3} = \frac{3 \log 3}{\log 3} = 3.
     \]

4. **Verify the denominator is not zero:**
   - Since \(3 > 1\), \(\log 3 > 0\), so the denominator is not zero.

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have`

```lean4
theorem mathd_algebra_484 : Real.log 27 / Real.log 3 = 3 := by
  have h_main : Real.log 27 = 3 * Real.log 3 := by
    sorry
  have h_final : Real.log 27 / Real.log 3 = 3 := by
    sorry
  exact h_final
```

### Explanation:
1. `h_main`: We first prove that \(\log 27 = 3 \log 3\) using the logarithm power rule and the fact that \(27 = 3^3\).
2. `h_final`: We then use `h_main` to simplify the original fraction \(\frac{\log 27}{\log 3}\) to \(3\).
3. The `exact` statement uses `h_final` to complete the proof.
