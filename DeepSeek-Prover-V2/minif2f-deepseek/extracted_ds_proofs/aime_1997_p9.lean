### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem and the given conditions:

1. **Variables and Hypotheses**:
   - \( a > 0 \)
   - \( \langle a^{-1} \rangle = \langle a^2 \rangle \) (where \( \langle x \rangle = x - \lfloor x \rfloor \))
   - \( 2 < a^2 < 3 \)

2. **Goal**:
   - Prove that \( a^{12} - 144 a^{-1} = 233 \).

#### Observations:
1. The condition \( 2 < a^2 < 3 \) implies that \( a \) is in the interval \( \sqrt{2} < a < \sqrt{3} \).
2. The fractional part \( \langle x \rangle \) is always in \( [0, 1) \), so \( \langle a^{-1} \rangle = a^{-1} - \lfloor a^{-1} \rfloor \) and similarly for \( \langle a^2 \rangle \).
3. The condition \( \langle a^{-1} \rangle = \langle a^2 \rangle \) can be rewritten as:
   \[
   a^{-1} - \lfloor a^{-1} \rfloor = a^2 - \lfloor a^2 \rfloor.
   \]
4. The condition \( 2 < a^2 < 3 \) implies that \( \lfloor a^2 \rfloor = 2 \), because \( a^2 \) is in \( (2, 3) \).
5. Similarly, \( \sqrt{2} < a < \sqrt{3} \) implies that \( \lfloor a^{-1} \rfloor = 0 \), because \( a^{-1} > 1/\sqrt{3} > 1/2 \).

#### Step 1: Prove \( \lfloor a^2 \rfloor = 2 \)
Since \( 2 < a^2 < 3 \), the only integer in this interval is \( 2 \). Hence, \( \lfloor a^2 \rfloor = 2 \).

#### Step 2: Prove \( \lfloor a^{-1} \rfloor = 0 \)
Since \( a > \sqrt{2} \), we have \( a^{-1} < 1/\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}/2 \approx 0.707 \). But \( a^{-1} > 1/\sqrt{3} \approx 0.577 \). However, we can directly compute \( a^{-1} \):
Since \( a^2 < 3 \), \( a < \sqrt{3} \), so \( a^{-1} > 1/\sqrt{3} \approx 0.577 \). But we need a lower bound.

But we can use the condition \( a^2 > 2 \), so \( a > \sqrt{2} \), and thus \( a^{-1} < 1/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.707 \). But we need an upper bound.

But we can use the condition \( a^2 < 3 \), so \( a < \sqrt{3} \), and thus \( a^{-1} > 1/\sqrt{3} \approx 0.577 \).

But we need to find \( \lfloor a^{-1} \rfloor \).

Since \( a^2 > 2 \), \( a > \sqrt{2} \), and thus \( a^{-1} < 1/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.707 \).

Since \( a^2 < 3 \), \( a < \sqrt{3} \), and thus \( a^{-1} > 1/\sqrt{3} \approx 0.577 \).

But \( 1/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.707 \), and \( 1/\sqrt{3} \approx 0.577 \).

Thus, \( 0.577 < a^{-1} < 0.707 \).

Therefore, \( \lfloor a^{-1} \rfloor = 0 \).

#### Step 3: Rewrite the Given Condition
The given condition is:
\[
a^{-1} - \lfloor a^{-1} \rfloor = a^2 - \lfloor a^2 \rfloor.
\]
Substituting the values from Steps 1 and 2:
\[
a^{-1} - 0 = a^2 - 2.
\]
Thus:
\[
a^{-1} = a^2 - 2.
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( a \)
Multiply both sides by \( a \):
\[
1 = a^3 - 2a.
\]
Rearrange:
\[
a^3 - 2a - 1 = 0.
\]
We can factor this as:
\[
(a + 1)(a^2 - a - 1) = 0.
\]
The roots are:
1. \( a = -1 \), but \( a > 0 \), so this is invalid.
2. \( a^2 - a - 1 = 0 \), which gives \( a = (1 \pm \sqrt{5})/2 \).

But \( a^2 < 3 \), so \( a < \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \).

Thus, \( a = (1 - \sqrt{5})/2 \approx (1 - 2.236)/2 \approx -0.618 \), which is invalid.

The other root is \( a = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx (1 + 2.236)/2 \approx 1.618 \).

But \( a^2 = (1 + \sqrt{5})^2 / 4 = (1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5)/4 = (6 + 2\sqrt{5})/4 = (3 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx (3 + 2.236)/2 \approx 2.618 \).

But \( a^2 < 3 \), so this is valid.

Thus, the only solution is \( a = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2 \).

#### Step 5: Compute \( a^{12} - 144 a^{-1} \)
First, compute \( a^{12} \):
Since \( a^2 = (3 + \sqrt{5})/2 \), we can find higher powers.

But we can use the recurrence relation derived from the quadratic equation.

The roots of \( x^2 - (3 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0 \) are \( a \) and \( 1/a \).

Thus, \( a^2 = (3 + \sqrt{5})a - 1 \).

Similarly, \( a^3 = (3 + \sqrt{5})a^2 - a \), and so on.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that \( a \) is a root of \( x^2 - (3 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0 \), so:
\[
a^{12} - (3 + \sqrt{5})a^{11} + a^{10} = 0.
\]
Similarly, for \( a^{-1} \), we have:
\[
a^{-1} = (3 + \sqrt{5}) - a^2 = (3 + \sqrt{5}) - \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
a^{12} - 144 a^{-1} = a^{12} - 144 \left( \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) = a^{12} - 72 (3 + \sqrt{5}).
\]
But we need to find \( a^{12} \).

From the recurrence relation, we can compute powers of \( a \):
\[
a^2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad a^3 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} a, \quad \text{etc.}
\]
But this seems tedious.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that \( a \) is a root of \( x^2 - (3 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0 \), so:
\[
a^2 = (3 + \sqrt{5})a - 1.
\]
Similarly, \( a^3 = (3 + \sqrt{5})a^2 - a \), and so on.

But this seems complicated.
