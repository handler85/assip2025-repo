### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem Analysis:**
We need to find the sum of all real numbers `x` that satisfy the equation `|2 - x| = 3`. 

**Approach:**
1. Solve the equation `|2 - x| = 3` to find all real solutions.
2. The equation `|2 - x| = 3` is equivalent to `2 - x = 3` or `2 - x = -3`.
   - `2 - x = 3` gives `x = -1`.
   - `2 - x = -3` gives `x = 5`.
3. The set `S` of all real numbers `x` satisfying `|2 - x| = 3` is `S = {-1, 5}`.
4. The sum of all elements in `S` is `-1 + 5 = 4`.

**Verification:**
1. For `x = -1`: `|2 - (-1)| = |3| = 3` ✔️.
2. For `x = 5`: `|2 - 5| = |-3| = 3` ✔️.
3. No other real numbers satisfy the equation.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Find all real solutions to `|2 - x| = 3`:**
   - Solve `2 - x = 3` to get `x = -1`.
   - Solve `2 - x = -3` to get `x = 5`.
   - No other real solutions exist.

2. **Construct the set `S`:**
   - `S = {-1, 5}`.

3. **Compute the sum of elements in `S`:**
   - `-1 + 5 = 4`.
