### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
- We are considering the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12.
- The odd integers between 0 and 12 are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.
- We need to find the units digit of this product, i.e., the product modulo 10.

#### Step 1: List the odd integers
The odd integers between 0 and 12 are:
\[ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 \]

#### Step 2: Compute the product
The product is:
\[ 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 11 \]

#### Step 3: Compute the product modulo 10
We can compute the product step by step modulo 10:
1. \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \)
2. \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \equiv 5 \mod 10 \)
3. \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \equiv 5 \mod 10 \)
4. \( 5 \times 9 = 45 \equiv 5 \mod 10 \)
5. \( 5 \times 11 = 55 \equiv 5 \mod 10 \)

Thus, the units digit is 5.

#### Step 4: Verify the product
Alternatively, we can compute the product directly:
\[ 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 11 = 10395 \]
and check that \( 10395 \mod 10 = 5 \).

### Step 5: Abstract Plan
1. List the odd integers between 0 and 12: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.
2. Compute the product step by step modulo 10:
   - Multiply the first two numbers: \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \).
   - Multiply by the next number: \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \equiv 5 \mod 10 \).
   - Multiply by the next number: \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \equiv 5 \mod 10 \).
   - Multiply by the next number: \( 5 \times 9 = 45 \equiv 5 \mod 10 \).
   - Multiply by the last number: \( 5 \times 11 = 55 \equiv 5 \mod 10 \).
3. The final result is 5.
