### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the remainder when the sum \( S = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{100} \) is divided by 7. 

#### Step 1: Find a closed form for \( S \)
The sum \( S \) is a geometric series with first term \( a = 1 \), common ratio \( r = 2 \), and \( n = 101 \) terms. The sum is:
\[ S = \frac{1 \cdot (2^{101} - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1. \]

#### Step 2: Compute \( 2^{101} \mod 7 \)
We need to find \( 2^{101} \mod 7 \). First, observe the cycle of powers of 2 modulo 7:
- \( 2^1 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)
- \( 2^2 \equiv 4 \mod 7 \)
- \( 2^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
- \( 2^4 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)
- ...
The cycle repeats every 3 steps. Since \( 101 \div 3 = 33 \) with a remainder of \( 2 \), we have:
\[ 2^{101} \equiv 2^{3 \cdot 33 + 2} \equiv (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 4 \equiv 4 \mod 7. \]

#### Step 3: Compute \( S \mod 7 \)
Since \( S = 2^{101} - 1 \), we have:
\[ S \mod 7 = (2^{101} - 1) \mod 7 = (4 - 1) \mod 7 = 3 \mod 7. \]

Thus, the remainder is \( 3 \).

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Sum**:
   - The sum is a geometric series with first term 1, common ratio 2, and 101 terms.
   - The sum is \( S = 2^{101} - 1 \).

2. **Find \( 2^{101} \mod 7 \)**:
   - The powers of 2 modulo 7 cycle every 3 steps: \( 2, 4, 1 \).
   - \( 101 \mod 3 = 2 \), so \( 2^{101} \mod 7 = 4 \).

3. **Find \( S \mod 7 \)**:
   - \( S = 2^{101} - 1 \).
   - \( 2^{101} \mod 7 = 4 \), so \( S \mod 7 = (4 - 1) \mod 7 = 3 \).
