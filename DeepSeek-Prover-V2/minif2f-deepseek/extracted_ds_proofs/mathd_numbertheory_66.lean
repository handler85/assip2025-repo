### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the remainder of 194 when divided by 11. This means we want to find the unique integer \( r \) such that \( 0 \leq r < 11 \) and \( 194 \equiv r \mod 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Division
We can perform the division of 194 by 11 to find the remainder:
\[ 194 \div 11 = 17 \text{ with a remainder of } 7 \]
This is because:
\[ 11 \times 17 = 187 \]
\[ 194 - 187 = 7 \]
Thus, \( 194 \mod 11 = 7 \).

#### Step 2: Verification
Alternatively, we can use the property that:
\[ a \mod b = a - b \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor \]
Here, \( a = 194 \), \( b = 11 \):
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{194}{11} \right\rfloor = 17 \]
\[ 194 - 11 \cdot 17 = 194 - 187 = 7 \]
Thus, \( 194 \mod 11 = 7 \).

#### Step 3: Conclusion
The remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 7.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find \( 194 \mod 11 \).
2. **Find the Quotient**: Compute \( 194 \div 11 \) to get the integer part.
   - \( 11 \times 17 = 187 \).
   - \( 194 - 187 = 7 \).
3. **Verify the Remainder**: The remainder is 7 because \( 11 \times 17 + 7 = 194 \).
4. **Conclusion**: \( 194 \mod 11 = 7 \).
