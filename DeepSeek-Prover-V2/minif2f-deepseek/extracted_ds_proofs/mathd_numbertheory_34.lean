### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find all natural numbers `x` such that `x * 9 ≡ 1 mod 100` and `x < 100`. We are to show that `x = 89` is the unique solution.

#### Step 1: Understand the Congruence
The congruence `x * 9 ≡ 1 mod 100` means that `100` divides `9 * x - 1`, i.e., `9 * x - 1 = 100 * k` for some integer `k ≥ 0`.

#### Step 2: Solve for `x`
We can rearrange the equation to:
`9 * x = 100 * k + 1`
`x = (100 * k + 1) / 9`

Since `x` is a natural number, `100 * k + 1` must be divisible by `9`. We can find all `k` such that `100 * k + 1 ≡ 0 mod 9`.

First, simplify `100 mod 9`:
`100 = 9 * 11 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 9`

Thus, the condition becomes:
`100 * k + 1 ≡ k * 1 + 1 ≡ k + 1 ≡ 0 mod 9`
`k ≡ -1 ≡ 8 mod 9`

So, `k = 9 * m + 8` for some `m ≥ 0`.

Substitute back into `x`:
`x = (100 * k + 1) / 9 = (100 * (9 * m + 8) + 1) / 9 = (900 * m + 800 + 1) / 9 = (900 * m + 801) / 9 = 100 * m + 89`

Thus, `x = 100 * m + 89` for some `m ≥ 0`.

#### Step 3: Find the Smallest `x`
Since `x < 100`, we have `100 * m + 89 < 100` or `100 * m < 11` or `m < 11 / 100 = 0.11`.

Thus, the only possible value for `m` is `m = 0`, giving `x = 89`.

#### Verification
For `m = 0`, `x = 89`:
`9 * 89 = 801` and `801 mod 100 = 1` is correct.

For `m = 1`, `x = 189`:
`9 * 189 = 1701` and `1701 mod 100 = 1` is correct, but `189 ≥ 100` is invalid.

Thus, `x = 89` is the unique solution.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Congruence**:
   - The condition `x * 9 ≡ 1 mod 100` means that `100` divides `9 * x - 1`.

2. **Find All Possible `x`**:
   - We can express `x` in terms of `k` such that `9 * x = 100 * k + 1`.
   - Simplify `100 mod 9` to find that `k ≡ 8 mod 9`.
   - Substitute back to get `x = 100 * m + 89` for some `m ≥ 0`.

3. **Find the Smallest `x`**:
   - Since `x < 100`, the only possible `m` is `m = 0`, giving `x = 89`.

4. **Verification**:
   - Check that `x = 89` satisfies the original condition.
