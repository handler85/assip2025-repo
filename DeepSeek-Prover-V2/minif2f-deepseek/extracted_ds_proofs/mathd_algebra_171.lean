### Detailed Proof

**Problem:** Consider the function \( f(x) = 5x + 4 \). What is \( f(1) \)? Show that it is 9.

**Solution:**
1. We are given the function \( f(x) = 5x + 4 \).
2. To find \( f(1) \), substitute \( x = 1 \) into the function:
   \[
   f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9.
   \]
3. Therefore, \( f(1) = 9 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Function:**
   - The function \( f(x) \) is defined as \( 5x + 4 \).

2. **Substitute the Input:**
   - Replace \( x \) with \( 1 \) in the function.

3. **Perform the Arithmetic:**
   - Calculate \( 5 \cdot 1 + 4 \).

4. **Simplify the Result:**
   - The result is \( 9 \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of \( f(1) \) is \( 9 \).
