### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have two complex equations:
1. \( f + 3z = 11 \) (Equation A)
2. \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \) (Equation B)

We need to find \( f \) and \( z \) such that both equations are satisfied. The solution is given as \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).

**Approach:**
1. First, expand Equation B to eliminate the parentheses.
2. Then, use Equation A to substitute for \( f + 3z \) in Equation B.
3. Solve the resulting linear equation for \( z \).
4. Substitute the value of \( z \) back into Equation A to find \( f \).
5. Verify that the solution satisfies both original equations.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Expand Equation B:**
   \[
   3(f - 1) - 5z = 3f - 3 - 5z = 3f - 5z - 3
   \]
   So, the equation becomes:
   \[
   3f - 5z - 3 = -68
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3f - 5z = -65 \quad \text{(Equation C)}
   \]

2. **We now have two equations:**
   \[
   \text{A: } f + 3z = 11
   \]
   \[
   \text{C: } 3f - 5z = -65
   \]

3. **Solve for \( f \) in terms of \( z \) from Equation A:**
   \[
   f = 11 - 3z
   \]

4. **Substitute \( f = 11 - 3z \) into Equation C:**
   \[
   3(11 - 3z) - 5z = -65
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   33 - 9z - 5z = -65
   \]
   \[
   33 - 14z = -65
   \]
   \[
   -14z = -98
   \]
   \[
   z = 7
   \]

5. **Find \( f \) using \( z = 7 \):**
   \[
   f = 11 - 3 \cdot 7 = 11 - 21 = -10
   \]

6. **Verification:**
   - Substitute \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \) into Equation A:
     \[
     -10 + 3 \cdot 7 = -10 + 21 = 11
     \]
   - Substitute into Equation B:
     \[
     3(-10 - 1) - 5 \cdot 7 = 3(-11) - 35 = -33 - 35 = -68
     \]
   Both equations are satisfied.

### Step 2: Abstract Plan

1. **Expand Equation B:**
   - Distribute the 3 inside the parentheses.
   - Combine like terms to simplify the equation.

2. **Substitute and Solve for \( z \):**
   - Use the simplified form of Equation B and the original Equation A to eliminate \( f \).
   - Solve the resulting linear equation for \( z \).

3. **Find \( f \):**
   - Substitute the value of \( z \) back into the original Equation A to find \( f \).

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that both original equations are satisfied with the found values of \( f \) and \( z \).
