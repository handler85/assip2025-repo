### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have two complex equations:
1. \( f + 3z = 11 \) (Equation A)
2. \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \) (Equation B)

We need to find \( f \) and \( z \) such that both equations are satisfied.

**Approach:**
First, expand Equation B to eliminate the parentheses:
\[ 3(f - 1) - 5z = 3f - 3 - 5z \]
So, Equation B becomes:
\[ 3f - 3 - 5z = -68 \]
\[ 3f - 5z = -65 \] (Equation C)

Now, we have the system:
1. \( f + 3z = 11 \) (Equation A)
2. \( 3f - 5z = -65 \) (Equation C)

We can solve this system for \( f \) and \( z \).

**Solving the System:**

**Method 1: Elimination**
Multiply Equation A by 3:
\[ 3(f + 3z) = 3 \cdot 11 \]
\[ 3f + 9z = 33 \] (Equation D)

Now, subtract Equation C from Equation D:
\[ (3f + 9z) - (3f - 5z) = 33 - (-65) \]
\[ 3f + 9z - 3f + 5z = 33 + 65 \]
\[ 14z = 98 \]
\[ z = 7 \]

Substitute \( z = 7 \) back into Equation A:
\[ f + 3 \cdot 7 = 11 \]
\[ f + 21 = 11 \]
\[ f = -10 \]

Thus, the solution is \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).

**Verification:**
1. \( f + 3z = -10 + 21 = 11 \) ✔️
2. \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = 3(-10 - 1) - 5 \cdot 7 = 3(-11) - 35 = -33 - 35 = -68 \) ✔️

### Step 2: Abstract Plan

1. **Expand Equation B:**
   - Distribute the 3 inside the parentheses: \( 3(f - 1) = 3f - 3 \).
   - Rewrite Equation B as \( 3f - 3 - 5z = -68 \).
   - Simplify to \( 3f - 5z = -65 \).

2. **Form a New System:**
   - Equation A: \( f + 3z = 11 \).
   - Equation C: \( 3f - 5z = -65 \).

3. **Solve the System:**
   - Multiply Equation A by 3: \( 3f + 9z = 33 \).
   - Subtract Equation C from this result: \( (3f + 9z) - (3f - 5z) = 33 - (-65) \).
   - Simplify to get \( 14z = 98 \), so \( z = 7 \).
   - Substitute \( z = 7 \) back into Equation A to find \( f = -10 \).

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that both original equations are satisfied with \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
