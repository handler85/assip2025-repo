### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two positive integers \( m \) and \( n \):
\[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \cdot \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \cdot n. \]

Given:
1. \(\text{gcd}(m, n) = 6\),
2. \(\text{lcm}(m, n) = 126\),

we can substitute these into the relationship to find \( m \cdot n \):
\[ 6 \cdot 126 = m \cdot n \implies m \cdot n = 756. \]

Next, we need to find the minimum possible value of \( m + n \). To do this, we can use the **AM-GM inequality**, which states that for positive real numbers \( a \) and \( b \),
\[ a + b \geq 2 \sqrt{ab}. \]

In our case, \( a = m \), \( b = n \), and \( ab = 756 \). Thus:
\[ m + n \geq 2 \sqrt{756}. \]

We can simplify \( \sqrt{756} \) by factoring it:
\[ 756 = 36 \times 21 = 6^2 \times 21. \]
Thus:
\[ \sqrt{756} = \sqrt{6^2 \times 21} = 6 \sqrt{21}. \]
Therefore:
\[ m + n \geq 2 \times 6 \sqrt{21} = 12 \sqrt{21}. \]

However, \( 12 \sqrt{21} \approx 12 \times 4.58 \approx 55.0 \), which is less than \( 60 \). This suggests that our lower bound is not tight enough, and we need a better approach to find the actual minimum.

#### Better Approach: Use the gcd and lcm to find possible values of \( m \) and \( n \)

Given that \(\text{gcd}(m, n) = 6\), we can write \( m = 6a \) and \( n = 6b \), where \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \).

Then, the lcm becomes:
\[ \text{lcm}(m, n) = \text{lcm}(6a, 6b) = 6 \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) = 126. \]
Thus:
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = 21. \]

Since \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \) and \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = 21 \), the possible pairs \((a, b)\) are:
1. \((1, 21)\),
2. \((3, 7)\),
3. \((7, 3)\),
4. \((21, 1)\).

For each pair, we can find \( m + n \):
1. \((1, 21)\): \( m = 6 \times 1 = 6 \), \( n = 6 \times 21 = 126 \), \( m + n = 132 \).
2. \((3, 7)\): \( m = 6 \times 3 = 18 \), \( n = 6 \times 7 = 42 \), \( m + n = 60 \).
3. \((7, 3)\): \( m = 6 \times 7 = 42 \), \( n = 6 \times 3 = 18 \), \( m + n = 60 \).
4. \((21, 1)\): \( m = 6 \times 21 = 126 \), \( n = 6 \times 1 = 6 \), \( m + n = 132 \).

The minimum value of \( m + n \) is \( 60 \).

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Use the gcd-lcm product relationship**:
   - From \(\text{gcd}(m, n) = 6\) and \(\text{lcm}(m, n) = 126\), we get \(m \cdot n = 756\).

2. **Express \(m\) and \(n\) in terms of their gcd**:
   - Let \(m = 6a\) and \(n = 6b\), where \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 1\).

3. **Find \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\)**:
   - \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{m \cdot n}{\text{gcd}(m, n)} = \frac{756}{6} = 126\).
   - But \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} = a \cdot b \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)\), which is incorrect. Instead, we use the fact that \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} = a \cdot b \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)\), but this is circular. A better approach is to directly find \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\) by testing possible pairs \((a, b)\) with \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 1\) and \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = 126\).

4. **Find possible pairs \((a, b)\)**:
   - The positive integer pairs \((a, b)\) with \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 1\) and \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = 126\) are:
     - \((1, 126)\), \((2, 63)\), \((3, 42)\), \((6, 21)\), \((7, 18)\), \((9, 14)\), \((14, 9)\), \((18, 7)\), \((21, 6)\), \((42, 3)\), \((63, 2)\), \((126, 1)\).

5. **Find corresponding \(m\) and \(n\)**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), \(m = 6a\) and \(n = 6b\).
   - Calculate \(m + n\) for each case and find the minimum.

6. **Verify the minimum**:
   - The smallest sum is \(60\), achieved when \(m = 18\) and \(n = 42\) (or vice versa).
