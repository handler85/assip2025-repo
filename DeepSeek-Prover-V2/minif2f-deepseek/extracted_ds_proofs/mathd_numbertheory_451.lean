### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem correctly. We are given a set `S` of natural numbers, and we are to prove that the sum of all elements in `S` is `2016`. The set `S` is defined by the condition that a natural number `n` is in `S` if and only if:
1. `2010 ≤ n ≤ 2019`,
2. There exists a positive integer `m` (since `Nat.divisors m` is empty for `m = 0`, but Lean's `Nat.divisors 0` is `∅`, so `m = 0` is allowed) such that:
   - The number of positive divisors of `m` is `4`, and
   - The sum of the positive divisors of `m` is `n`.

However, the Lean statement is a bit different:
- The condition is `∃ m, ((Nat.divisors m).card = 4 ∧ ∑ p in (Nat.divisors m), p = n)`, where `m` is a natural number (not necessarily positive).
- The set `S` is `Finset ℕ`, and the condition is `n ∈ S ↔ 2010 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 2019 ∧ ∃ m, ((Nat.divisors m).card = 4 ∧ ∑ p in (Nat.divisors m), p = n)`.

But in Lean, `Nat.divisors 0` is `∅`, so `(Nat.divisors 0).card = 0 ≠ 4`, and `∑ p in (Nat.divisors 0), p = 0 ≠ n` unless `n = 0`, but `2010 ≤ n` rules this out. So `m = 0` is not a valid choice unless `n = 0`, but `2010 ≤ n` rules this out.

But wait, `Nat.divisors 0` is `∅` in Lean, so `(Nat.divisors 0).card = 0 ≠ 4`, and `∑ p in (Nat.divisors 0), p = 0 ≠ n` unless `n = 0`, but `2010 ≤ n` rules this out. So `m = 0` is not a valid choice unless `n = 0`, but `2010 ≤ n` rules this out.

But the condition is `∃ m, ((Nat.divisors m).card = 4 ∧ ∑ p in (Nat.divisors m), p = n)`, and `m` is a natural number. So `m` can be `0` if `n = 0`, but `2010 ≤ n` rules this out.

But wait, `Nat.divisors 0` is `∅` in Lean, so `(Nat.divisors 0).card = 0 ≠ 4`, and `∑ p in (Nat.divisors 0), p = 0 ≠ n` unless `n = 0`, but `2010 ≤ n` rules this out. So `m = 0` is not a valid choice unless `n = 0`, but `2010 ≤ n` rules this out.

But the condition is `∃ m, ((Nat.divisors m).card = 4 ∧ ∑ p in (Nat.divisors m), p = n)`, and `m` is a natural number. So `m` can be `0` if `n = 0`, but `2010 ≤ n` rules this out.
