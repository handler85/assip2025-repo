### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall that `σ : Equiv ℝ ℝ` is an equivalence (bijection) from `ℝ` to `ℝ`. The inverse of `σ` is denoted by `σ.2` (i.e., `σ.2 = σ⁻¹`). The forward direction of `σ` is denoted by `σ.1` (i.e., `σ.1 = σ`). 

Given:
1. `σ.2 2 = 10` (i.e., `σ(10) = 2`).
2. `σ.2 10 = 1` (i.e., `σ(1) = 10`).
3. `σ.2 1 = 2` (i.e., `σ(2) = 1`).

We need to prove that `σ.1 (σ.1 10) = 1`.

#### Step 1: Understand the Given Information

First, note that `σ.2` is the inverse of `σ.1`, i.e., `σ.1 (σ.2 x) = x` and `σ.2 (σ.1 x) = x` for all `x ∈ ℝ`.

Given:
1. `σ.2 2 = 10` ⇒ `σ.1 10 = 2` (by applying `σ.1` to both sides).
2. `σ.2 10 = 1` ⇒ `σ.1 1 = 10` (by applying `σ.1` to both sides).
3. `σ.2 1 = 2` ⇒ `σ.1 2 = 1` (by applying `σ.1` to both sides).

#### Step 2: Compute `σ.1 (σ.1 10)`

From the first given condition, we have `σ.1 10 = 2`. Therefore:
`σ.1 (σ.1 10) = σ.1 2`.

From the third given condition, we have `σ.1 2 = 1`. Therefore:
`σ.1 (σ.1 10) = 1`.

This completes the proof.

### Step 3: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the given conditions**:
   - `σ.2 2 = 10` ⇒ `σ.1 10 = 2`.
   - `σ.2 10 = 1` ⇒ `σ.1 1 = 10`.
   - `σ.2 1 = 2` ⇒ `σ.1 2 = 1`.

2. **Compute `σ.1 (σ.1 10)`**:
   - `σ.1 10 = 2` ⇒ `σ.1 (σ.1 10) = σ.1 2 = 1`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - `σ.1 (σ.1 10) = 1`.
