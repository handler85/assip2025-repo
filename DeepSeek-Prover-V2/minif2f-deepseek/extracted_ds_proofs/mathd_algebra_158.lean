### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We have:
1. `a` is an even natural number (`Even a`).
2. The sum of the first 8 odd numbers (starting from 1) minus the sum of 5 consecutive even numbers starting from `a` is `4` (as an integer).

The first sum of the first 8 odd numbers is:
\[ \sum_{k=0}^7 (2k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64 \]

The second sum is:
\[ \sum_{k=0}^4 (a + 2k) = a + 2a + 4a + 6a + 8a = 19a \]

The condition becomes:
\[ 64 - 19a = 4 \]
\[ 64 - 4 = 19a \]
\[ 60 = 19a \]
\[ a = \frac{60}{19} \]

This is incorrect because `a` is a natural number. The mistake is that the second sum is:
\[ \sum_{k=0}^4 (a + 2k) = a + 2a + 4a + 6a + 8a = 21a \]

Wait, no:
\[ \sum_{k=0}^4 (a + 2k) = (a + 0) + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 5a + (0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8) = 5a + 20 \]

But earlier, I misapplied the sum. The correct second sum is:
\[ \sum_{k=0}^4 (a + 2k) = 5a + 20 \]

Thus, the condition becomes:
\[ 64 - (5a + 20) = 4 \]
\[ 64 - 20 - 4 = 5a \]
\[ 40 = 5a \]
\[ a = 8 \]

This is correct because `a` is a natural number and `8` is even.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Sums**:
   - The first sum is the sum of the first 8 odd numbers, which is `64`.
   - The second sum is the sum of 5 consecutive even numbers starting from `a`, which is `5a + 20`.

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The difference between the two sums is `4`, so:
     \[ 64 - (5a + 20) = 4 \]

3. **Solve for `a`**:
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[ 64 - 20 - 4 = 5a \]
     \[ 40 = 5a \]
     \[ a = 8 \]

4. **Verify the Solution**:
   - Check that `a = 8` is even and satisfies the original condition.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements
