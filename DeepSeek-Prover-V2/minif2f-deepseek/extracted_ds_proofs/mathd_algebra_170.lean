### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
- We have a set `S` of integers `n` such that `|n - 2| ≤ 5 + 6/10 = 5.6` (since `6/10 = 0.6`).
- We need to find the cardinality of `S` and show that it is `11`.

#### Step 1: Understand the Inequality `|n - 2| ≤ 5.6`

First, note that `5.6 = 56 / 10 = 28 / 5`. The inequality can be rewritten as:
\[ -5.6 \leq n - 2 \leq 5.6 \]
or equivalently:
\[ 2 - 5.6 \leq n \leq 2 + 5.6 \]
\[ -3.6 \leq n \leq 7.6 \]

But since `n` is an integer, we can find all integers `n` such that `-3.6 ≤ n ≤ 7.6`. The integers in this range are `-3, -2, ..., 7`.

#### Step 2: Count the Integers in `S`

The integers from `-3` to `7` inclusive are:
\[ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \]
This is a total of `11` integers.

#### Step 3: Verify the Solution

We can also verify that no other integers satisfy the original inequality. For example:
- If `n = -4`, then `|n - 2| = 6 > 5.6`.
- If `n = 8`, then `|n - 2| = 6 > 5.6`.
Thus, the solution is correct.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Inequality**:
   - The condition `|n - 2| ≤ 5.6` is equivalent to `-3.6 ≤ n ≤ 7.6` for integers `n`.

2. **Find Integer Solutions**:
   - The integers in `[-3.6, 7.6]` are `-3, -2, ..., 7`.

3. **Count the Solutions**:
   - The count is `7 - (-3) + 1 = 11`.

4. **Verify No Extraneous Solutions**:
   - Check that no integer outside `[-3, 7]` satisfies the inequality.
