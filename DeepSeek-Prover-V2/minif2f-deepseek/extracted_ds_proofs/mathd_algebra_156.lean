### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the problem:
We have two functions:
- \( f(t) = t^4 \)
- \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \)

We are given that:
1. \( f(x) = g(x) \)
2. \( f(y) = g(y) \)
3. \( x^2 < y^2 \)

We need to prove that \( y^2 - x^2 = 1 \).

#### Step 1: Rewrite the Equations
From \( f(x) = g(x) \), we have:
\[ x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \]
Rearrange:
\[ x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \]

Similarly, from \( f(y) = g(y) \), we have:
\[ y^4 = 5y^2 - 6 \]
Rearrange:
\[ y^4 - 5y^2 + 6 = 0 \]

#### Step 2: Factor the Quadratic in \( t^2 \)
Notice that \( x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) \). Similarly, \( y^4 - 5y^2 + 6 = (y^2 - 2)(y^2 - 3) \).

Thus, the equations become:
\[ (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0 \]
\[ (y^2 - 2)(y^2 - 3) = 0 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \)
The roots of \( (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0 \) are \( x^2 = 2 \) and \( x^2 = 3 \).

Similarly, the roots of \( (y^2 - 2)(y^2 - 3) = 0 \) are \( y^2 = 2 \) and \( y^2 = 3 \).

#### Step 4: Enumerate Possible Cases
Given \( x^2 < y^2 \), we consider all possible ordered pairs of \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \):
1. \( x^2 = 2 \), \( y^2 = 3 \)
2. \( x^2 = 3 \), \( y^2 = 2 \) (but this violates \( x^2 < y^2 \))
3. \( x^2 = 2 \), \( y^2 = 2 \) (but this violates \( x^2 < y^2 \))
4. \( x^2 = 3 \), \( y^2 = 3 \) (but this violates \( x^2 < y^2 \))

The only valid case is \( x^2 = 2 \), \( y^2 = 3 \), which gives \( y^2 - x^2 = 1 \).

#### Verification
Check that \( x^2 = 2 \), \( y^2 = 3 \) satisfy all conditions:
1. \( x^2 < y^2 \): \( 2 < 3 \) is true.
2. \( f(x) = g(x) \): \( 2^4 = 16 \), \( 5 \cdot 2^2 - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 \). Wait, \( 16 \neq 4 \). This is incorrect!

Oops, I made a mistake in the verification. The correct \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \) should satisfy \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \) and \( y^4 = 5y^2 - 6 \).

Let me re-solve the equations correctly.

#### Correct Solution

From \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \), we have:
\[ x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \]
Let \( z = x^2 \), then:
\[ z^2 - 5z + 6 = 0 \]
Solutions:
\[ z = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2} \]
Thus:
\[ z = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad z = 2 \]
So:
\[ x^2 = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \]

Similarly, from \( y^4 = 5y^2 - 6 \), we have:
\[ y^4 - 5y^2 + 6 = 0 \]
Let \( w = y^2 \), then:
\[ w^2 - 5w + 6 = 0 \]
Solutions:
\[ w = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2} \]
Thus:
\[ w = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad w = 2 \]
So:
\[ y^2 = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad y^2 = 2 \]

Given \( x^2 < y^2 \), the possible cases are:
1. \( x^2 = 2 \), \( y^2 = 3 \)
2. \( x^2 = 3 \), \( y^2 = 2 \) (but this violates \( x^2 < y^2 \))
3. \( x^2 = 2 \), \( y^2 = 2 \) (but this violates \( x^2 < y^2 \))
4. \( x^2 = 3 \), \( y^2 = 3 \) (but this violates \( x^2 < y^2 \))

The only valid case is \( x^2 = 2 \), \( y^2 = 3 \), which gives \( y^2 - x^2 = 1 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We have two functions \( f(t) = t^4 \) and \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \).
   - We are given \( f(x) = g(x) \) and \( f(y) = g(y) \), and \( x^2 < y^2 \).
   - We need to prove \( y^2 - x^2 = 1 \).

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - From \( f(x) = g(x) \), we get \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \).
   - From \( f(y) = g(y) \), we get \( y^4 = 5y^2 - 6 \).

3. **Solve for \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \)**:
   - Rewrite \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \) as \( x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \).
   - Let \( z = x^2 \), then \( z^2 - 5z + 6 = 0 \).
   - Solutions: \( z = 2 \) or \( z = 3 \).
   - Similarly, \( y^2 = 2 \) or \( y^2 = 3 \).

4. **Enumerate Cases**:
   - Given \( x^2 < y^2 \), the possible ordered pairs are:
     - \( (2, 3) \)
     - \( (3, 2) \) (invalid)
   - The only valid case is \( x^2 = 2 \), \( y^2 = 3 \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - In this case, \( y^2 - x^2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \).
