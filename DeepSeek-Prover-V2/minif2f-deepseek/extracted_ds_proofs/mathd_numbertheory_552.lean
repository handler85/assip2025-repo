### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We have three functions:
1. `f : ℕ⁺ → ℕ` defined by `f(x) = 12 * x + 7` for `x ∈ ℕ⁺`.
2. `g : ℕ⁺ → ℕ` defined by `g(x) = 5 * x + 2` for `x ∈ ℕ⁺`.
3. `h : ℕ⁺ → ℕ` defined by `h(x) = gcd(f(x), g(x))` for `x ∈ ℕ⁺`.

We are to find the sum of all possible values of `h(x)` for `x ∈ ℕ⁺`, and the problem claims this sum is `12`. 

But wait, the Lean theorem statement is a bit different:
1. The functions `f`, `g`, `h` are given as inputs to the theorem, and their definitions are `h₀`, `h₁`, `h₂`.
2. The hypothesis `h₃` is that the set `Set.range h` is finite (i.e., `h` is a function with finite range).
3. The goal is to prove that the sum of all elements in `Set.range h` is `12`.

But the Lean theorem is not quite correct as stated, because `h` is not necessarily a function with finite range. For example, if we define `f(x) = x` and `g(x) = 0` for all `x`, then `h(x) = gcd(x, 0) = x`, and `Set.range h` is `ℕ`, which is infinite. 

But in the given Lean theorem, `f` and `g` are arbitrary functions, and `h` is defined as `h(x) = gcd(f(x), g(x))`. The hypothesis `h₃` is that `Set.range h` is finite.

The answer is no, unless we impose additional constraints on `f` and `g`. 

For example, if `f(x) = x` and `g(x) = 0` for all `x`, then `h(x) = x`, and `Set.range h` is `ℕ`, which is infinite.
