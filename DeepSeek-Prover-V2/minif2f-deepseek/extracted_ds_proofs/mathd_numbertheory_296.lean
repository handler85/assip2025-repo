### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
- We are given a natural number `n ≥ 2` such that:
  1. `n` is a perfect cube, i.e., there exists an integer `x` such that `x³ = n`.
  2. `n` is a perfect fourth power, i.e., there exists an integer `t` such that `t⁴ = n`.
- We need to prove that `n ≥ 4096`.

#### Key Observations:
1. The smallest perfect cube is `1³ = 1`, but `n ≥ 2` is given, so we can ignore `n = 1`.
2. The smallest perfect fourth power is `0⁴ = 0`, but `n ≥ 2` is given, so we can ignore `n = 0`.
3. The next smallest perfect cube is `2³ = 8`, and the next perfect fourth power is `2⁴ = 16`. But `8 ≠ 16`, so no overlap here.
4. The next perfect cube is `3³ = 27`, and the next perfect fourth power is `2⁴ = 16` (no, `2⁴ = 16` is not a perfect cube). The next perfect fourth power is `3⁴ = 81`, and the next perfect cube is `4³ = 64` (no, `4³ = 64` is not a perfect fourth power). The next perfect fourth power is `4⁴ = 256`, and the next perfect cube is `5³ = 125` (no, `5³ = 125` is not a perfect fourth power). The next perfect fourth power is `5⁴ = 625`, and the next perfect cube is `6³ = 216` (no, `6³ = 216` is not a perfect fourth power). The next perfect fourth power is `6⁴ = 1296`, and the next perfect cube is `7³ = 343` (no, `7³ = 343` is not a perfect fourth power). The next perfect fourth power is `7⁴ = 2401`, and the next perfect cube is `8³ = 512` (no, `8³ = 512` is not a perfect fourth power). The next perfect fourth power is `8⁴ = 4096`, and the next perfect cube is `9³ = 729` (no, `9³ = 729` is not a perfect fourth power). The next perfect fourth power is `9⁴ = 6561`, and the next perfect cube is `10³ = 1000` (no, `10³ = 1000` is not a perfect fourth power).
