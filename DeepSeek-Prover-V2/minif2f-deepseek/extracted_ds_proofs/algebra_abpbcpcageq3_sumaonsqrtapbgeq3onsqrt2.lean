### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem and the inequality we are trying to prove.

**Given:**
1. \( a, b, c > 0 \).
2. \( 3 \leq ab + bc + ca \).

**To prove:**
\[ \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b + c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c + a}}. \]

**Approach:**
1. We will use the **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** and **Jensen's inequality** to bound the sum of the fractions.
2. The denominators \(\sqrt{a + b}\), etc., suggest that we can use the **QM-AM inequality** to relate them to the terms inside.
3. We will also use the given condition \( ab + bc + ca \geq 3 \) to find a lower bound for the sum of the fractions.

**Key Observations:**
1. The term \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}}\) can be bounded below by \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2a}}\) because \(a + b \geq a\) and \(\sqrt{a + b} \geq \sqrt{a}\). However, this is not directly helpful because \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2a}} = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}}\) is not true (the inequality is reversed). So, this naive approach is not fruitful.
2. Instead, we can use the **Titu's lemma** (a special case of Cauchy-Schwarz) to write:
   \[ \sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} = \sum \frac{a^2}{a \sqrt{a + b}} \geq \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{\sum a \sqrt{a + b}}. \]
   However, this seems complicated to work with.
3. A better approach is to use the **Jensen's inequality** for the convex function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \). However, the terms inside the denominators are not directly \( a + b \), etc.
4. Alternatively, we can use the **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** in a clever way. Notice that:
   \[ \left( \sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \right) \left( \sum a \sqrt{a + b} \right) \geq (a + b + c)^2. \]
   But this is not directly helpful because we need a lower bound for the LHS.
5. A more promising approach is to use the **AM-GM inequality** to find a lower bound for the sum of the fractions. Notice that:
   \[ \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{a + b}}{\sqrt{a + b}} = \frac{a \sqrt{a + b}}{a + b}. \]
   Similarly for the other terms. Thus, the sum becomes:
   \[ \sum \frac{a \sqrt{a + b}}{a + b}. \]
   We can now use the **Titu's lemma** to get:
   \[ \sum \frac{a \sqrt{a + b}}{a + b} \geq \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{\sum (a + b)} = \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{2(a + b + c)} = \frac{a + b + c}{2}. \]
   But we need to prove that this is at least \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \). However, this is not true in general, as \( \frac{a + b + c}{2} \geq \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \) is not implied by \( ab + bc + ca \geq 3 \). For example, take \( a = b = c = 1 \), then \( ab + bc + ca = 3 \geq 3 \), and \( \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \geq \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 2.12 \). But if \( a = b = c = \sqrt{3} \), then \( ab + bc + ca = 9 \geq 3 \), and \( \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 2.598 \geq \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 2.12 \). It seems that the bound is correct, but we need to verify it carefully.

   Alternatively, we can use the **Jensen's inequality** for the convex function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \). The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) is convex for \( x > 0 \). Thus, by Jensen's inequality:
   \[ \frac{f(a + b) + f(b + c) + f(c + a)}{3} \geq f\left( \frac{(a + b) + (b + c) + (c + a)}{3} \right) = f\left( \frac{2(a + b + c)}{3} \right). \]
   Therefore:
   \[ \sum \frac{1}{\sqrt{a + b}} \geq \frac{3}{\sqrt{\frac{2(a + b + c)}{3}}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{a + b + c}}. \]
   This seems to be going in the wrong direction, as we need a lower bound for \( \sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \).

**Correct Approach:**
Instead, we can use the **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** in a clever way. Notice that:
\[ \left( \sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \right) \left( \sum a \sqrt{a + b} \right) \geq (a + b + c)^2. \]
But we need a lower bound for \( \sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \). To find it, we can use the **Titu's lemma** to get:
\[ \sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \geq \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{\sum a \sqrt{a + b}}. \]
But this is not directly helpful. Instead, we can use the **Jensen's inequality** for the convex function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \).

### Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to prove that the sum of \( \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \) is at least \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \) under the condition \( ab + bc + ca \geq 3 \).

2. **Use Known Inequalities**: We can use the **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** in a clever way to relate the sum of \( \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \) to the sum \( \sum a \sqrt{a + b} \).

3. **Apply Titu's Lemma**: By the **Titu's lemma**, we have:
   \[ \sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \geq \frac{(\sum a)^2}{\sum a \sqrt{a + b}}. \]
   However, this is not directly helpful. Instead, we can use the **Jensen's inequality** for the convex function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \).

4. **Use Jensen's Inequality**: The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \) is convex. By **Jensen's inequality**, we have:
   \[ \sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \geq \frac{1}{\sum \frac{1}{\sqrt{a + b}}}. \]
   This is also not directly helpful. Instead, we can use the **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** in a different form.

5. **Final Approach**: We can use the **Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** in the form:
   \[ \left( \sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \right) \left( \sum a \sqrt{a + b} \right) \geq (a + b + c)^2. \]
   Then, we can use the **Titu's lemma** to get:
   \[ \sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} \geq \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{\sum a \sqrt{a + b}}. \]
   Finally, we can use the given condition \( ab + bc + ca \geq 3 \) to show that:
   \[ \frac{(a + b + c)^2}{\sum a \sqrt{a + b}} \geq \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
