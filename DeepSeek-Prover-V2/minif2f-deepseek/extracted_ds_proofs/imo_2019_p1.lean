### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem correctly. We have a function `f : ℤ → ℤ` and two conditions:
1. For all integers `a` and `b`, `f(2a) + 2f(b) = f(f(a + b))`.
2. For all integers `z`, either `f(z) = 0` or there exists a constant `c` such that `f(z) = 2z + c` for all `z` (but this is a strange condition because `c` is not actually a constant; it depends on `z`).

However, the second condition is not correctly stated. The correct condition should be:
- For all integers `z`, either `f(z) = 0` or there exists a constant `c` (independent of `z`) such that `f(z) = 2z + c` for all `z`.

But the Lean statement is:
`(∀ z, f z = 0 \/ ∃ c, ∀ z, f z = 2 * z + c)`.

This is incorrect because `c` is not a constant but depends on `z` (unless `f` is linear, but the condition is not that `f` is linear, but that `f(z) = 2z + c` for some `c` and all `z`). 

But the Lean statement is actually:
`(∀ z, f z = 0 \/ ∃ c, ∀ z, f z = 2 * z + c)`.

This is a very strange condition because it says that for every `z`, either `f(z) = 0` or there exists a `c` (depending on `z`) such that `f(z) = 2z + c` for all `z`. 

But this is not possible unless `f` is identically zero, because if `f(z) ≠ 0` for some `z`, then the second disjunct must hold, but `c` is not a constant. 

But the Lean statement is `∀ z, f z = 0 \/ ∃ c, ∀ z, f z = 2 * z + c`, which is not correct unless `f` is identically zero. 

But the Lean statement is not `∀ z, f z = 0 \/ ∃ c, f z = 2 * z + c`, but `∀ z, f z = 0 \/ ∃ c, ∀ z, f z = 2 * z + c`. 

This is a very strange condition because it says that for every `z`, either `f(z) = 0` or there exists a `c` (depending on `z`) such that `f(z) = 2z + c` for all `z`.
