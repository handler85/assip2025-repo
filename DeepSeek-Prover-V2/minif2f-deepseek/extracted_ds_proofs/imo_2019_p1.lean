/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to prove the equivalence:
\[ \forall a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, f(2a) + 2f(b) = f(f(a + b)) \]
is equivalent to:
\[ \forall z \in \mathbb{Z}, f(z) = 0 \lor \exists c \in \mathbb{Z}, \forall z \in \mathbb{Z}, f(z) = 2z + c. \]

#### Step 1: Prove the forward direction (⇒)
Assume the functional equation holds for all integers \(a, b\). We will show that \(f\) is either identically zero or of the form \(f(z) = 2z + c\) for some constant \(c \in \mathbb{Z}\).

1. **Evaluate at \(a = 0, b = 0\)**:
   \[ f(0) + 2f(0) = f(f(0)) \implies 3f(0) = f(f(0)). \]
   This is equation (1).

2. **Evaluate at \(a = 0, b = z\)**:
   \[ f(0) + 2f(z) = f(f(z)). \]
   This is equation (2).

3. **Evaluate at \(a = x, b = 0\)**:
   \[ f(2x) + 2f(0) = f(f(x)). \]
   This is equation (3).

4. **Evaluate at \(a = x, b = -x\)**:
   \[ f(2x) + 2f(-x) = f(f(0)). \]
   This is equation (4).

5. **Evaluate at \(a = x, b = x\)**:
   \[ f(2x) + 2f(x) = f(f(2x)). \]
   This is equation (5).

6. **Evaluate at \(a = -x, b = x\)**:
   \[ f(-2x) + 2f(x) = f(f(0)). \]
   This is equation (6).

7. **Evaluate at \(a = x, b = -2x\)**:
   \[ f(2x) + 2f(-2x) = f(f(-x)). \]
   This is equation (7).

8. **Evaluate at \(a = 2x, b = -x\)**:
   \[ f(4x) + 2f(-x) = f(f(3x)). \]
   This is equation (8).

However, we can simplify the problem by considering specific cases.

**Case 1: \(f(0) = 0\)**
From equation (1), \(3f(0) = f(f(0)) \implies 0 = f(0) \implies f(0) = 0\).

Now, set \(b = 0\) in the original equation:
\[ f(2a) + 2f(0) = f(f(a + 0)) \implies f(2a) = f(f(a)). \]

Set \(a = 0\) in the above:
\[ f(0) = f(f(0)) \implies 0 = 0. \]

Set \(a = -x\) in the above:
\[ f(-2x) = f(f(-x)). \]

Set \(a = x\) in the above:
\[ f(2x) = f(f(x)). \]

Now, set \(a = x\) and \(b = -x\) in the original equation:
\[ f(2x) + 2f(-x) = f(f(0)) \implies f(2x) + 2f(-x) = 0. \]

But from \(f(2a) = f(f(a))\), we have \(f(2x) = f(f(x))\) and \(f(2(-x)) = f(f(-x)) \implies f(-2x) = f(f(-x))\).

This seems complicated, but we can try to find a pattern.

Assume \(f(z) = c\) is constant. Then:
\[ f(2a) + 2f(b) = c + 2c = 3c, \]
and
\[ f(f(a + b)) = f(c) = c. \]
Thus, \(3c = c \implies c = 0\). So \(f(z) = 0\) is a solution.

Assume \(f\) is not constant. We can try to find a linear form. Suppose \(f(z) = kz + c\). Then:
\[ f(2a) = k(2a) + c = 2ka + c, \]
\[ 2f(b) = 2(kb + c) = 2kb + 2c, \]
\[ f(f(a + b)) = f(k(a + b) + c) = k(k(a + b) + c) + c = k^2(a + b) + kc + c. \]
Thus, the functional equation becomes:
\[ 2ka + c + 2kb + 2c = k^2(a + b) + kc + c, \]
\[ 2ka + 2kb + 3c = k^2(a + b) + kc, \]
\[ 2k(a + b) + 3c = k^2(a + b) + kc, \]
\[ 2k(a + b) - k^2(a + b) = kc - 3c, \]
\[ (2k - k^2)(a + b) = (k - 3)c. \]
This must hold for all integers \(a, b\).

**Subcase 1: \(2k - k^2 = 0\)**
This gives \(k(2 - k) = 0\), so \(k = 0\) or \(k = 2\).

If \(k = 0\), the equation becomes \(0 = (0 - 3)c \implies 0 = -3c \implies c = 0\). Thus, \(f(z) = 0\) is a solution.

If \(k = 2\), the equation becomes \((2 \cdot 2 - 2^2)(a + b) = (2 - 3)c \implies 0 = -c \implies c = 0\). Thus, \(f(z) = 2z\) is a solution.

**Subcase 2: \(2k - k^2 \neq 0\)**
The equation \((2k - k^2)(a + b) = (k - 3)c\) must hold for all integers \(a, b\). This is only possible if \(k - 3 = 0\) and \(2k - k^2 = 0\), i.e., \(k = 3\) and \(k = 0\) or \(k = 3\). But \(k = 3\) gives \(2k - k^2 = -3 \neq 0\), so this is not possible.

Thus, the only solutions are \(f(z) = 0\) and \(f(z) = 2z\).

#### Step 2: Prove the backward direction (⇐)
Assume that for all integers \(z\), either \(f(z) = 0\) or \(f(z) = 2z + c\) for some constant \(c \in \mathbb{Z}\). We need to show that the functional equation holds for all integers \(a, b\).

1. **Case 1: \(f(z) = 0\) for all \(z\)**
   The functional equation becomes:
   \[ f(2a) + 2f(b) = 0 + 2 \cdot 0 = 0, \]
   and
   \[ f(f(a + b)) = f(0) = 0. \]
   Thus, the equation holds.

2. **Case 2: \(f(z) = 2z + c\) for some constant \(c \in \mathbb{Z}\)**
   The functional equation becomes:
   \[ f(2a) + 2f(b) = 2(2a) + c + 2(2b + c) = 4a + c + 4b + 2c = 4a + 4b + 3c, \]
   and
   \[ f(f(a + b)) = f(2(a + b) + c) = 2(2(a + b) + c) + c = 4(a + b) + 2c + c = 4a + 4b + 3c. \]
   Thus, the equation holds.

In both cases, the functional equation holds.

### Step 3: Abstract Plan

1. **Forward Direction (⇒)**:
   - Assume the functional equation holds for all integers \(a, b\).
   - Prove that \(f(0) = 0\).
   - Use the functional equation to derive \(f(2a) = f(f(a))\) and \(f(-2a) = f(f(-a))\).
   - Assume \(f\) is not identically zero and derive a linear form \(f(z) = 2z + c\).

2. **Backward Direction (⇐)**:
   - Assume \(f(z) = 0\) or \(f(z) = 2z + c\) for some constant \(c\).
   - Verify the functional equation holds in both cases.
