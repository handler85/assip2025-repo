### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given a sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` with the following properties:
1. For all `n ∈ ℕ`, `a(n + 2) - a(n + 1) = a(n + 1) - a(n)`.
2. `a(1) = 2/3`.
3. `a(9) = 4/5`.

We need to prove that `a(5) = 11/15`.

#### Step 1: Understand the Recurrence Relation
The condition `a(n + 2) - a(n + 1) = a(n + 1) - a(n)` can be rewritten as:
`a(n + 2) - a(n + 1) = d`, where `d = a(n + 1) - a(n)` is a constant for all `n`.

This means that the sequence `a` is **arithmetic** with a common difference `d`.

#### Step 2: Find the Common Difference `d`
Given `a(1) = 2/3` and `a(9) = 4/5`, we can find `d` as follows:

First, note that `a(9) = a(1) + 8 * d` because the sequence is arithmetic.

Thus:
`4/5 = 2/3 + 8 * d`

Solve for `d`:
`4/5 - 2/3 = 8 * d`
`(12 - 10)/15 = 8 * d`
`2/15 = 8 * d`
`d = (2/15)/8 = 2/120 = 1/60`

#### Step 3: Find `a(5)`
Now, we can find `a(5)` using the arithmetic sequence formula:
`a(5) = a(1) + 4 * d`
`a(5) = 2/3 + 4 * (1/60)`
`a(5) = 2/3 + 4/60`
`a(5) = 2/3 + 1/15`
`a(5) = (10 + 1)/15 = 11/15`

Thus, `a(5) = 11/15`.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Recurrence**:
   - The condition `a(n + 2) - a(n + 1) = a(n + 1) - a(n)` implies that the sequence is arithmetic with a common difference `d`.

2. **Find the Common Difference `d`**:
   - Use the given values `a(1) = 2/3` and `a(9) = 4/5` to find `d = 1/60`.

3. **Find `a(5)`**:
   - Use the arithmetic sequence formula to find `a(5) = 11/15`.
