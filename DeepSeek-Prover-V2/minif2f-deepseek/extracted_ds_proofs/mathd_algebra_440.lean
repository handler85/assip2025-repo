/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. The given equation is:
\[ \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{3} = \frac{x}{10} \]

This can be simplified as follows:
1. The left-hand side is \(\frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\).
2. So, the equation becomes \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}\).
3. Cross-multiplying gives \(10 \times 1 = 2 \times x\), i.e., \(10 = 2x\).
4. Dividing both sides by 2 gives \(x = 5\).

But wait, let's double-check the simplification of the left-hand side:
\[ \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{3} = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]
This is correct. So, the equation is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10} \]

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the LHS**:
   - \(\frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2}\).

2. **Cross-multiply**:
   - \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}\) becomes \(10 \times 1 = 2 \times x\), i.e., \(10 = 2x\).

3. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   - \(x = \frac{10}{2} = 5\).

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4
