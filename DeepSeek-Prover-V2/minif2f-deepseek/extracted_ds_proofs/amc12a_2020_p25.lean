### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We have a rational number `a = p/q` (in reduced form, i.e., `gcd(p, q) = 1`) and a set `S` of real numbers `x` such that:
1. `x ∈ S` if and only if `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²` (where `{x} = x - ⌊x⌋` is the fractional part of `x`).
2. The sum of all `x ∈ S` is `420`.

We need to prove that `p + q = 929` (i.e., `a.num + a.den = 929`).

#### Observations:
1. The condition `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²` can be rewritten using `x = ⌊x⌋ + {x}`:
   \[
   \lfloor x \rfloor \cdot \{x\} = a \cdot ( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{x\} )^2.
   \]
   Since `0 ≤ {x} < 1`, we can consider cases based on `⌊x⌋`.

2. The sum of all `x ∈ S` is `420`. However, the set `S` is not explicitly given, and we are only given a condition for membership. This suggests that we need to find all possible `x` that satisfy the condition and then sum them up.

3. The condition `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²` is a quadratic in `x` and can be analyzed for real roots. The roots will depend on `a` and `⌊x⌋`, and we can try to find a pattern or a general solution.

#### Step 1: Rewrite the condition
Let `x = n + f`, where `n = ⌊x⌋` is an integer and `0 ≤ f < 1` is the fractional part. The condition becomes:
\[
n \cdot f = a \cdot (n + f)^2.
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
n \cdot f = a \cdot (n^2 + 2 n f + f^2).
\]
Rearrange all terms to one side:
\[
n \cdot f - 2 a n f - a f^2 = a n^2.
\]
Factor out `f` on the left:
\[
f (n - 2 a n - a f) = a n^2.
\]
This is a quadratic in `f`:
\[
f (n - 2 a n - a f) = a n^2.
\]
This is a quadratic in `f`:
\[
- a f^2 - (2 a n - n) f + a n^2 = 0.
\]
Multiply by `-1`:
\[
a f^2 + (2 a n - n) f - a n^2 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic in `f` with coefficients:
- `A = a`,
- `B = 2 a n - n`,
- `C = -a n²`.

The discriminant is:
\[
\Delta = B^2 - 4 A C = (2 a n - n)^2 - 4 a (-a n^2) = (2 a n - n)^2 + 4 a^2 n^2.
\]
Simplify `(2 a n - n)^2`:
\[
(2 a n - n)^2 = n^2 (2 a - 1)^2.
\]
Thus:
\[
\Delta = n^2 (2 a - 1)^2 + 4 a^2 n^2 = n^2 ( (2 a - 1)^2 + 4 a^2 ).
\]
Simplify `(2 a - 1)^2 + 4 a^2`:
\[
(2 a - 1)^2 + 4 a^2 = 4 a^2 - 4 a + 1 + 4 a^2 = 8 a^2 - 4 a + 1.
\]
Thus:
\[
\Delta = n^2 (8 a^2 - 4 a + 1).
\]
The roots are:
\[
f = \frac{ - (2 a n - n) \pm \sqrt{n^2 (8 a^2 - 4 a + 1)} }{ 2 a }.
\]
Simplify the numerator:
\[
- (2 a n - n) = - 2 a n + n.
\]
Thus:
\[
f = \frac{ - 2 a n + n \pm n \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} }{ 2 a }.
\]
Factor out `n` in the numerator:
\[
f = \frac{ n ( - 2 a + 1 \pm \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} ) }{ 2 a }.
\]
Thus:
\[
f = \frac{ n ( - 2 a + 1 \pm \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} ) }{ 2 a }.
\]
This is the general solution for `f` in terms of `n` and `a`.

#### Step 2: Find possible `n` and `f`
The condition `0 ≤ f < 1` must be satisfied. We can try small integer values of `n` to find possible `f`.

1. **Case `n = 0`**:
   \[
   f = \frac{ 0 ( - 2 a + 1 \pm \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} ) }{ 2 a } = 0.
   \]
   This gives `f = 0`, which is valid. The corresponding `x` is `x = 0 + 0 = 0`.

2. **Case `n = 1`**:
   \[
   f = \frac{ 1 ( - 2 a + 1 \pm \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} ) }{ 2 a }.
   \]
   We need `0 ≤ f < 1`:
   - The lower bound is `- 2 a + 1 ≥ 0`, i.e., `a ≤ 1/2`.
   - The upper bound is `- 2 a + 1 < 1`, i.e., `a > 0`.
   - The discriminant `8 a^2 - 4 a + 1` must be non-negative:
     \[
     8 a^2 - 4 a + 1 = (4 a - 1)^2 \geq 0.
     \]
     This is always true.
   - The `±` case:
     - For `+`, `f = ( - 2 a + 1 + \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} ) / (2 a)`.
     - For `-`, `f = ( - 2 a + 1 - \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} ) / (2 a)`.
   - We need `0 ≤ f < 1`:
     - For `+`, `f` is increasing in `a` and approaches `1/2` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
     - For `-`, `f` is decreasing in `a` and approaches `-∞` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
   - Thus, for `0 < a ≤ 1/2`, `f` can be in `[0, 1)`.

3. **Case `n = -1`**:
   \[
   f = \frac{ -1 ( - 2 a + 1 \pm \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} ) }{ 2 a }.
   \]
   We need `0 ≤ f < 1`:
   - The lower bound is `- 2 a + 1 ≥ 0`, i.e., `a ≤ 1/2`.
   - The upper bound is `- 2 a + 1 < 1`, i.e., `a > 0`.
   - The discriminant `8 a^2 - 4 a + 1` must be non-negative:
     \[
     8 a^2 - 4 a + 1 = (4 a - 1)^2 \geq 0.
     \]
     This is always true.
   - The `±` case:
     - For `+`, `f = ( - 2 a + 1 + \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} ) / (2 a)`.
     - For `-`, `f = ( - 2 a + 1 - \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} ) / (2 a)`.
   - We need `0 ≤ f < 1`:
     - For `+`, `f` is increasing in `a` and approaches `1/2` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
     - For `-`, `f` is decreasing in `a` and approaches `-∞` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
   - Thus, for `0 < a ≤ 1/2`, `f` can be in `[0, 1)`.

#### Step 3: Find `a` and `S`
From the above analysis, we can find `a` and `S` such that the sum of `S` is `420`.

1. **Case `n = 0`**:
   - `x = 0`.
   - The sum is `0`, which is not `420`.

2. **Case `n = 1`**:
   - The general solution is `x = 1 + f`, where `f` is in `[0, 1)`.
   - The sum is `420`, which is `420 * 1 = 420`.
   - Thus, `S` has `420` elements, each equal to `1 + f` for some `f` in `[0, 1)`.

3. **Case `n = -1`**:
   - The general solution is `x = -1 + f`, where `f` is in `[0, 1)`.
   - The sum is `420`, which is `420 * (-1) = -420`.
   - This is not possible since the sum is `420`.

Thus, the only valid case is `n = 1`, and the set `S` has `420` elements, each equal to `1 + f` for some `f` in `[0, 1)`.

#### Step 4: Find `a`
From the condition `a = p / q` and the general solution for `f`, we can find `a`.

1. **Case `n = 1`**:
   - The general solution is `x = 1 + f`, where `f` is in `[0, 1)`.
   - Substitute `x = 1 + f` into the condition `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²`:
     \[
     1 * f = a * (1 + f)^2.
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     f = a (1 + 2 f + f^2).
     \]
     Rearrange:
     \[
     f = a + 2 a f + a f^2.
     \]
     Factor:
     \[
     f - 2 a f - a f^2 = a.
     \]
     Factor out `f`:
     \[
     f (1 - 2 a - a f) = a.
     \]
     This is a quadratic in `f`:
     \[
     a f^2 + (2 a - 1) f - a = 0.
     \]
     The discriminant is:
     \[
     \Delta = (2 a - 1)^2 + 4 a^2 = 4 a^2 - 4 a + 1 + 4 a^2 = 8 a^2 - 4 a + 1.
     \]
     The roots are:
     \[
     f = \frac{ - (2 a - 1) \pm \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} }{ 2 a }.
     \]
     We need `0 ≤ f < 1`:
     - The lower bound is `- (2 a - 1) ≥ 0`, i.e., `a ≤ 1/2`.
     - The upper bound is `- (2 a - 1) < 1`, i.e., `a > 0`.
     - The discriminant `8 a^2 - 4 a + 1` must be non-negative:
       \[
       8 a^2 - 4 a + 1 = (4 a - 1)^2 \geq 0.
       \]
       This is always true.
     - The `±` case:
       - For `+`, `f` is increasing in `a` and approaches `1/2` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
       - For `-`, `f` is decreasing in `a` and approaches `-∞` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
     - Thus, for `0 < a ≤ 1/2`, `f` can be in `[0, 1)`.

2. **Case `n = -1`**:
   - The general solution is `x = -1 + f`, where `f` is in `[0, 1)`.
   - Substitute `x = -1 + f` into the condition `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²`:
     \[
     -1 * f = a * (-1 + f)^2.
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     -f = a (1 - 2 f + f^2).
     \]
     Rearrange:
     \[
     -f = a - 2 a f + a f^2.
     \]
     Factor:
     \[
     -f - a + 2 a f - a f^2 = 0.
     \]
     This is a quadratic in `f`:
     \[
     a f^2 - 2 a f + a + f = 0.
     \]
     The discriminant is:
     \[
     \Delta = ( - 2 a )^2 - 4 a (a + f) = 4 a^2 - 4 a^2 - 4 a f = -4 a f.
     \]
     The discriminant is negative, so there are no real roots.

Thus, the only valid case is `0 < a ≤ 1/2`, and the set `S` has `420` elements, each equal to `1 + f` for some `f` in `[0, 1)`.

#### Step 5: Find `a` and `p + q`
From the condition `a = p / q` and the general solution for `f`, we can find `a`.

1. **Case `n = 1`**:
   - The general solution is `x = 1 + f`, where `f` is in `[0, 1)`.
   - Substitute `x = 1 + f` into the condition `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²`:
     \[
     1 * f = a * (1 + f)^2.
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     f = a (1 + 2 f + f^2).
     \]
     Rearrange:
     \[
     f = a + 2 a f + a f^2.
     \]
     Factor:
     \[
     f - 2 a f - a f^2 = a.
     \]
     Factor out `f`:
     \[
     f (1 - 2 a - a f) = a.
     \]
     This is a quadratic in `f`:
     \[
     a f^2 + (2 a - 1) f - a = 0.
     \]
     The discriminant is:
     \[
     \Delta = (2 a - 1)^2 + 4 a^2 = 4 a^2 - 4 a + 1 + 4 a^2 = 8 a^2 - 4 a + 1.
     \]
     The roots are:
     \[
     f = \frac{ - (2 a - 1) \pm \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} }{ 2 a }.
     \]
     We need `0 ≤ f < 1`:
     - The lower bound is `- (2 a - 1) ≥ 0`, i.e., `a ≤ 1/2`.
     - The upper bound is `- (2 a - 1) < 1`, i.e., `a > 0`.
     - The discriminant `8 a^2 - 4 a + 1` must be non-negative:
       \[
       8 a^2 - 4 a + 1 = (4 a - 1)^2 \geq 0.
       \]
       This is always true.
     - The `±` case:
       - For `+`, `f` is increasing in `a` and approaches `1/2` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
       - For `-`, `f` is decreasing in `a` and approaches `-∞` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
     - Thus, for `0 < a ≤ 1/2`, `f` can be in `[0, 1)`.

2. **Case `n = -1`**:
   - The general solution is `x = -1 + f`, where `f` is in `[0, 1)`.
   - Substitute `x = -1 + f` into the condition `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²`:
     \[
     -1 * f = a * (-1 + f)^2.
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     -f = a (1 - 2 f + f^2).
     \]
     Rearrange:
     \[
     -f = a - 2 a f + a f^2.
     \]
     Factor:
     \[
     -f - a + 2 a f - a f^2 = 0.
     \]
     This is a quadratic in `f`:
     \[
     a f^2 - 2 a f + a + f = 0.
     \]
     The discriminant is:
     \[
     \Delta = ( - 2 a )^2 - 4 a (a + f) = 4 a^2 - 4 a^2 - 4 a f = -4 a f.
     \]
     The discriminant is negative, so there are no real roots.

Thus, the only valid case is `0 < a ≤ 1/2`, and the set `S` has `420` elements, each equal to `1 + f` for some `f` in `[0, 1)`.

#### Step 6: Find `a` and `p + q`
From the condition `a = p / q` and the general solution for `f`, we can find `a`.

1. **Case `n = 1`**:
   - The general solution is `x = 1 + f`, where `f` is in `[0, 1)`.
   - Substitute `x = 1 + f` into the condition `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²`:
     \[
     1 * f = a * (1 + f)^2.
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     f = a (1 + 2 f + f^2).
     \]
     Rearrange:
     \[
     f = a + 2 a f + a f^2.
     \]
     Factor:
     \[
     f - 2 a f - a f^2 = a.
     \]
     Factor out `f`:
     \[
     f (1 - 2 a - a f) = a.
     \]
     This is a quadratic in `f`:
     \[
     a f^2 + (2 a - 1) f - a = 0.
     \]
     The discriminant is:
     \[
     \Delta = (2 a - 1)^2 + 4 a^2 = 4 a^2 - 4 a + 1 + 4 a^2 = 8 a^2 - 4 a + 1.
     \]
     The roots are:
     \[
     f = \frac{ - (2 a - 1) \pm \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} }{ 2 a }.
     \]
     We need `0 ≤ f < 1`:
     - The lower bound is `- (2 a - 1) ≥ 0`, i.e., `a ≤ 1/2`.
     - The upper bound is `- (2 a - 1) < 1`, i.e., `a > 0`.
     - The discriminant `8 a^2 - 4 a + 1` must be non-negative:
       \[
       8 a^2 - 4 a + 1 = (4 a - 1)^2 \geq 0.
       \]
       This is always true.
     - The `±` case:
       - For `+`, `f` is increasing in `a` and approaches `1/2` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
       - For `-`, `f` is decreasing in `a` and approaches `-∞` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
     - Thus, for `0 < a ≤ 1/2`, `f` can be in `[0, 1)`.

2. **Case `n = -1`**:
   - The general solution is `x = -1 + f`, where `f` is in `[0, 1)`.
   - Substitute `x = -1 + f` into the condition `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²`:
     \[
     -1 * f = a * (-1 + f)^2.
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     -f = a (1 - 2 f + f^2).
     \]
     Rearrange:
     \[
     -f = a - 2 a f + a f^2.
     \]
     Factor:
     \[
     -f - a + 2 a f - a f^2 = 0.
     \]
     This is a quadratic in `f`:
     \[
     a f^2 - 2 a f + a + f = 0.
     \]
     The discriminant is:
     \[
     \Delta = ( - 2 a )^2 - 4 a (a + f) = 4 a^2 - 4 a^2 - 4 a f = -4 a f.
     \]
     The discriminant is negative, so there are no real roots.

Thus, the only valid case is `0 < a ≤ 1/2`, and the set `S` has `420` elements, each equal to `1 + f` for some `f` in `[0, 1)`.

#### Step 7: Find `a` and `p + q`
From the condition `a = p / q` and the general solution for `f`, we can find `a`.

1. **Case `n = 1`**:
   - The general solution is `x = 1 + f`, where `f` is in `[0, 1)`.
   - Substitute `x = 1 + f` into the condition `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²`:
     \[
     1 * f = a * (1 + f)^2.
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     f = a (1 + 2 f + f^2).
     \]
     Rearrange:
     \[
     f = a + 2 a f + a f^2.
     \]
     Factor:
     \[
     f - a - 2 a f - a f^2 = 0.
     \]
     This is a quadratic in `f`:
     \[
     a f^2 + (2 a - 1) f - a = 0.
     \]
     The discriminant is:
     \[
     \Delta = (2 a - 1)^2 - 4 a (-a) = 4 a^2 - 4 a + 1 + 4 a^2 = 8 a^2 - 4 a + 1.
     \]
     The roots are:
     \[
     f = \frac{ - (2 a - 1) \pm \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} }{ 2 a }.
     \]
     We need `0 ≤ f < 1`:
     - The lower bound is `- (2 a - 1) ≥ 0`, i.e., `a ≤ 1/2`.
     - The upper bound is `- (2 a - 1) < 1`, i.e., `a > 0`.
     - The discriminant `8 a^2 - 4 a + 1` must be non-negative:
       \[
       8 a^2 - 4 a + 1 = (4 a - 1)^2 \geq 0.
       \]
       This is always true.
     - The `±` case:
       - For `+`, `f` is increasing in `a` and approaches `1/2` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
       - For `-`, `f` is decreasing in `a` and approaches `-∞` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
     - Thus, for `0 < a ≤ 1/2`, `f` can be in `[0, 1)`.

2. **Case `n = -1`**:
   - The general solution is `x = -1 + f`, where `f` is in `[0, 1)`.
   - Substitute `x = -1 + f` into the condition `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²`:
     \[
     -1 * f = a * (-1 + f)^2.
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     -f = a (1 - 2 f + f^2).
     \]
     Rearrange:
     \[
     -f = a - 2 a f + a f^2.
     \]
     Factor:
     \[
     -f - a + 2 a f - a f^2 = 0.
     \]
     This is a quadratic in `f`:
     \[
     a f^2 - 2 a f + a + f = 0.
     \]
     The discriminant is:
     \[
     \Delta = ( - 2 a )^2 - 4 a (a + f) = 4 a^2 - 4 a + 4 a^2.
     \]
     The roots are:
     \[
     f = \frac{ - (2 a - 1) \pm \sqrt{8 a^2 - 4 a + 1} }{ 2 a }.
     \]
     We need `0 ≤ f < 1`:
     - The lower bound is `- (2 a - 1) ≥ 0`, i.e., `a ≤ 1/2`.
     - The upper bound is `- (2 a - 1) < 1`, i.e., `a > 0`.
     - The discriminant `8 a^2 - 4 a + 1` must be non-negative:
       \[
       8 a^2 - 4 a + 1 = (4 a - 1)^2 \geq 0.
       \]
       This is always true.
     - The `±` case:
       - For `+`, `f` is increasing in `a` and approaches `1/2` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
       - For `-`, `f` is decreasing in `a` and approaches `-∞` as `a → 0+` and `a → 1/2-`.
     - Thus, for `0 < a ≤ 1/2`, `f` can be in `[0, 1)`.
