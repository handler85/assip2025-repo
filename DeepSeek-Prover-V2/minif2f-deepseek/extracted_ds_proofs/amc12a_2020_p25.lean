### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We have a rational number `a = p / q` (in reduced form, i.e., `gcd(p, q) = 1`). The set `S` is defined as all real numbers `x` such that `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²`, where `{x} = x - ⌊x⌋` is the fractional part of `x`. The sum of all elements in `S` is `420`. We need to prove that `p + q = 929`.

However, the Lean 4 statement is slightly different:
1. The set `S` is defined as all real numbers `x` such that `⌊x⌋ * (x - ⌊x⌋) = a * x²` (i.e., `⌊x⌋ * {x} = a * x²`).
2. The sum of all elements in `S` is `420`.
3. We need to prove that `a.num + a.den = 929` (where `a.num` is the numerator of `a` in reduced form and `a.den` is the denominator of `a` in reduced form).

But wait, the Lean 4 statement is not quite the same as the original problem. In Lean, `a` is a rational number, and `a.num` and `a.den` are its numerator and denominator in reduced form. The original problem assumes `a = p / q` with `gcd(p, q) = 1`, but Lean's `a` is arbitrary. 

But the Lean 4 statement is still strange because `a` is arbitrary, and `S` is defined in terms of `a`, but `S` is not actually used in the conclusion `a.num + a.den = 929`. 

But the Lean 4 statement is correct because the problem is to find `p + q` under the assumption that `a = p / q` is given, and `S` is defined in terms of `a` and `S` is used to find `p + q = 929`.
