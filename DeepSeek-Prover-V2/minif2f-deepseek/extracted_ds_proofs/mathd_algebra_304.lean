### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to compute \(91^2\) and verify that it equals \(8281\). 

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We can think of \(91^2\) as \((90 + 1)^2\) to use the binomial expansion:
\[
(90 + 1)^2 = 90^2 + 2 \cdot 90 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281.
\]
Alternatively, we can directly compute \(91 \times 91\) as follows:
1. Multiply \(91 \times 1 = 91\).
2. Multiply \(91 \times 90 = 8190\) (since \(91 \times 9 = 819\) and then append a \(0\)).
3. Add the results: \(8190 + 91 = 8281\).

#### Step 2: Verification
Let's verify the direct multiplication:
1. \(91 \times 1 = 91\)
2. \(91 \times 90 = 8190\)
3. \(8190 + 91 = 8281\)

This confirms that \(91^2 = 8281\).

### Step 3: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to compute \(91^2\) and verify it equals \(8281\).
2. **Direct Multiplication**:
   - Multiply \(91 \times 1 = 91\).
   - Multiply \(91 \times 90 = 8190\).
   - Add the results: \(8190 + 91 = 8281\).
3. **Verification**:
   - The sum is correct, so \(91^2 = 8281\).
