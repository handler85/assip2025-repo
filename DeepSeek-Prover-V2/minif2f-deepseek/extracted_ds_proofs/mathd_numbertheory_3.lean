/- ### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers. The first nine positive integers are \(1, 2, \ldots, 9\). Their squares are:
\[
1^2 = 1, \quad 2^2 = 4, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 16, \quad 5^2 = 25, \quad 6^2 = 36, \quad 7^2 = 49, \quad 8^2 = 64, \quad 9^2 = 81.
\]
The sum of these squares is:
\[
1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81.
\]
Let's compute this step by step:
\[
1 + 4 = 5, \quad 5 + 9 = 14, \quad 14 + 16 = 30, \quad 30 + 25 = 55, \quad 55 + 36 = 91, \quad 91 + 49 = 140, \quad 140 + 64 = 204, \quad 204 + 81 = 285.
\]
Thus, the sum is \(285\). The units digit of \(285\) is \(5\).

But wait, we can also compute the sum more efficiently using the formula for the sum of squares of the first \(n\) positive integers:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.
\]
For \(n = 9\):
\[
\sum_{k=1}^9 k^2 = \frac{9 \cdot 10 \cdot 19}{6} = \frac{1710}{6} = 285.
\]
This confirms that the sum is \(285\), whose units digit is \(5\).

However, the problem is phrased in Lean as:
\[
\sum_{x \in \text{Finset.range } 10} (x + 1)^2 \mod 10 = 5.
\]
Here, `Finset.range 10` is `{0, 1, ..., 9}`, and the sum is over `x` in this set. The term `(x + 1)^2` is `(y)^2` where `y = x + 1` and `y` ranges from `1` to `10`. So the sum is the same as the sum of squares of the first `10` positive integers minus the square of `1` (but this is not correct; the sum is `(0 + 1)^2 + (1 + 1)^2 + ... + (9 + 1)^2 = 1 + 4 + ... + 100`).

But wait, the Lean code is:
```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_3 : (∑ x in Finset.range 10, (x + 1) ^ 2) % 10 = 5 := by
  sorry
```
This is correct. The sum is `(0 + 1)^2 + (1 + 1)^2 + ... + (9 + 1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 = 285`, and `285 % 10 = 5`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Sum**:
   - The sum is `∑ x in Finset.range 10, (x + 1)^2`, where `Finset.range 10` is `{0, 1, ..., 9}`.
   - The term `(x + 1)^2` is `(y)^2` where `y = x + 1` and `y` ranges from `1` to `10`.

2. **Compute the Sum**:
   - Calculate each term `(x + 1)^2` for `x` from `0` to `9`:
     - `(0 + 1)^2 = 1`
     - `(1 + 1)^2 = 4`
     - `(2 + 1)^2 = 9`
     - `(3 + 1)^2 = 16`
     - `(4 + 1)^2 = 25`
     - `(5 + 1)^2 = 36`
     - `(6 + 1)^2 = 49`
     - `(7 + 1)^2 = 64`
     - `(8 + 1)^2 = 81`
     - `(9 + 1)^2 = 100`
   - Sum all the terms: `1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 = 385`.

   - **Correction**: The sum is `285` (as calculated earlier). The mistake was in the initial calculation. The correct sum is `1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 = 285`.

3. **Find the Units Digit**:
   - The units digit of `285` is `5`.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements
