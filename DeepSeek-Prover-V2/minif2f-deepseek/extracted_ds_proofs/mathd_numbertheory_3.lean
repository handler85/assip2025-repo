### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, i.e., the sum of \(1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + 9^2\). 

The sum of the squares of the first \(n\) positive integers is given by the formula:
\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
\]
For \(n = 9\), the sum is:
\[
S = \frac{9 \cdot 10 \cdot 19}{6} = \frac{1710}{6} = 285
\]
The units digit of \(285\) is \(5\).

However, we can also compute the sum directly:
\[
1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + 9^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81
\]
Adding these terms:
\[
1 + 4 = 5\]
\[5 + 9 = 14\]
\[14 + 16 = 30\]
\[30 + 25 = 55\]
\[55 + 36 = 91\]
\[91 + 49 = 140\]
\[140 + 64 = 204\]
\[204 + 81 = 285\]
The units digit of \(285\) is \(5\).

But we can also observe that the sum of the squares of the first \(n\) positive integers modulo \(10\) cycles every \(10\) terms. We can compute the sum of the squares of the first \(10\) positive integers modulo \(10\):
\[
1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + 10^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100
\]
Adding these terms:
\[
1 + 4 = 5\]
\[5 + 9 = 14\]
\[14 + 16 = 30\]
\[30 + 25 = 55\]
\[55 + 36 = 91\]
\[91 + 49 = 140\]
\[140 + 64 = 204\]
\[204 + 81 = 285\]
\[285 + 100 = 385\]
The units digit of \(385\) is \(5\).

Alternatively, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the first \(n\) positive integers is congruent to \(0\) modulo \(4\) when \(n\) is even and to \(2\) modulo \(8\) when \(n\) is odd. For \(n = 9\) (odd), the sum is \(285\), which is \(5 \mod 10\).

But the most straightforward approach is to compute the sum directly and observe the units digit.

### Step 1: Compute the Sum of Squares

First, compute the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers:
\[
1^2 + 2^2 + \dots + 9^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81
\]

### Step 2: Add the Squares

Add the terms one by one:
\[
1 + 4 = 5\]
\[5 + 9 = 14\]
\[14 + 16 = 30\]
\[30 + 25 = 55\]
\[55 + 36 = 91\]
\[91 + 49 = 140\]
\[140 + 64 = 204\]
\[204 + 81 = 285\]

### Step 3: Find the Units Digit

The units digit of \(285\) is \(5\).

### Step 4: Verification

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of squares:
\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
\]
For \(n = 9\):
\[
S = \frac{9 \cdot 10 \cdot 19}{6} = \frac{1710}{6} = 285
\]
The units digit of \(285\) is \(5\).
