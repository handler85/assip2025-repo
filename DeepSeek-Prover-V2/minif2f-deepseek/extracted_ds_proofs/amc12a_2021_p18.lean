### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem and the given conditions:
1. The function `f` is defined on the set of positive rational numbers.
2. For all positive rational numbers `x` and `y`, `f(x * y) = f(x) + f(y)`.
3. For every prime number `p`, `f(p) = p`.
4. We need to prove that `f(25 / 11) < 0`.

#### Step 1: Understand the Functional Equation
The condition `f(x * y) = f(x) + f(y)` is multiplicative in nature. It resembles the logarithm function, which satisfies `log(x * y) = log(x) + log(y)`. However, the logarithm is defined for positive real numbers, and our `f` is defined for positive rational numbers.

But we can use the given condition to derive properties of `f`.

#### Step 2: Derive `f(1)`
Take `x = y = 1` in the functional equation:
`f(1 * 1) = f(1) + f(1)` ⇒ `f(1) = 2 * f(1)` ⇒ `f(1) = 0`.

#### Step 3: Derive `f(1/p)` for Prime `p`
Take `x = 1`, `y = 1/p` in the functional equation:
`f(1 * (1/p)) = f(1) + f(1/p)` ⇒ `f(1/p) = 0 + f(1/p)` ⇒ `f(1/p) = f(1/p)`.

This is a tautology and doesn't give us new information.

#### Step 4: Derive `f(1/q)` for `q` Composite
This seems less straightforward. Instead, let's think about `f(25/11)`.

First, factorize the numbers:
`25 = 5 * 5`, `11` is prime.

But we don't have `f(5)` or `f(11)` directly. However, we can use the functional equation to express `f(25/11)` in terms of `f(5)` and `f(11)`.

But we need to be careful because `25/11` is not a product of primes. 

Alternatively, we can use the fact that `25/11 = (5 * 5)/(11)` and apply the functional equation:
`f(25/11) = f(5 * 5 / 11) = f(5 * 5) - f(11) = f(5) + f(5) - f(11) = 2 * f(5) - f(11)`.

But we don't know `f(5)` or `f(11)`. 

However, we can use the given condition to find `f(5)`:
Take `x = 5`, `y = 1` in the functional equation:
`f(5 * 1) = f(5) + f(1)` ⇒ `f(5) = f(5) + 0` ⇒ `f(5) = f(5)`.

This is again a tautology. 

Similarly, take `x = 11`, `y = 1` in the functional equation:
`f(11 * 1) = f(11) + f(1)` ⇒ `f(11) = f(11) + 0` ⇒ `f(11) = f(11)`.

This is also a tautology. 

But we can use the given condition to find `f(5)` indirectly. 

Take `x = 5`, `y = 5` in the functional equation:
`f(5 * 5) = f(5) + f(5)` ⇒ `f(25) = 2 * f(5)`.

But we don't know `f(25)`. 

However, we can use the given condition to find `f(25)`:
Take `x = 5`, `y = 5` in the functional equation:
`f(5 * 5) = f(5) + f(5)` ⇒ `f(25) = 2 * f(5)`.

But we don't know `f(5)`. 

Alternatively, take `x = 5`, `y = 11` in the functional equation:
`f(5 * 11) = f(5) + f(11)` ⇒ `f(55) = f(5) + f(11)`.

But we don't know `f(55)`, `f(5)`, or `f(11)`. 

This seems too complicated. 

#### Step 5: Alternative Approach Using `f(1/p)`

Instead, let's think about `f(1/p)` for a prime `p`.

Take `x = 1/p`, `y = p` in the functional equation:
`f((1/p) * p) = f(1/p) + f(p)` ⇒ `f(1) = f(1/p) + f(p)` ⇒ `0 = f(1/p) + f(p)` ⇒ `f(1/p) = -f(p)`.

But we know `f(p) = p` by the given condition. 

Thus, `f(1/p) = -p`.

#### Step 6: Find `f(25/11)`

Now, recall that `25/11 = 25 * (1/11) = 25 * (1/11)`.

But we can also write `25/11 = (5 * 5) / 11 = 5 * (5 / 11) = 5 * (1/11) * 5 = 5 * 5 * (1/11) = 25 * (1/11)`.

Thus, `f(25/11) = f(25 * (1/11)) = f(25) + f(1/11) = f(5 * 5) + f(1/11) = f(5) + f(5) + f(1/11) = 2 * f(5) + f(1/11)`.

But we know `f(1/11) = -11` and `f(5) = 5` (since `5` is prime). 

Thus, `f(25/11) = 2 * 5 + (-11) = 10 - 11 = -1 < 0`.

This completes the proof.

### Step 7: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Functional Equation**:
   - The equation `f(x * y) = f(x) + f(y)` is multiplicative.
   - It resembles the logarithm function, but we don't know if `f` is logarithmic.

2. **Find `f(1)`**:
   - Plug `x = y = 1` into the equation to get `f(1) = 0`.

3. **Find `f(1/p)` for Prime `p`**:
   - Plug `x = 1/p`, `y = p` into the equation to get `f(1/p) = -f(p) = -p`.

4. **Find `f(25/11)`**:
   - Express `25/11` as `25 * (1/11)`.
   - Use the multiplicative property to get `f(25/11) = f(25) + f(1/11) = 2 * f(5) + f(1/11)`.
   - Substitute the known values to get `f(25/11) = -1 < 0`.
