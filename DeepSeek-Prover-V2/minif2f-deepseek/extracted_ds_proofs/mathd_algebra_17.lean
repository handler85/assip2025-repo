### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to solve for `a` in the equation:
\[ \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a}} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + a}} = 6. \]

#### Step 1: Understand the Domain
For the square roots to be real and defined, the expressions inside them must be non-negative:
1. \( 16 + 16a \geq 0 \Rightarrow a \geq -1 \).
2. \( 1 + a \geq 0 \Rightarrow a \geq -1 \).
3. \( 4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a} \geq 0 \) is always true since \( \sqrt{16 + 16a} \geq 0 \).
4. \( 1 + \sqrt{1 + a} \geq 0 \) is always true since \( \sqrt{1 + a} \geq 0 \).

Thus, the domain is \( a \geq -1 \).

#### Step 2: Guess the Solution
We can try to find `a` by testing simple integer values. Let's try `a = 8`:
1. \( 16 + 16 \cdot 8 = 16 + 128 = 144 \).
   - \( \sqrt{144} = 12 \).
   - \( 4 + 12 = 16 \).
   - \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).
2. \( 1 + a = 1 + 8 = 9 \).
   - \( \sqrt{9} = 3 \).
   - \( 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \).
3. The sum is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \), which matches the given equation.

Thus, `a = 8` is the solution.

#### Step 3: Prove Uniqueness
We need to show that `a = 8` is the only solution. Suppose `a > 8` or `a < 8` and check if the sum can be `6`.

1. **Case `a > 8`**:
   - \( 16 + 16a > 144 \), so \( \sqrt{16 + 16a} > 12 \), and \( 4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a} > 16 \), so \( \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a}} > 4 \).
   - \( 1 + a > 9 \), so \( \sqrt{1 + a} > 3 \), and \( 1 + \sqrt{1 + a} > 4 \), so \( \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + a}} > 2 \).
   - The sum is \( > 4 + 2 = 6 \), which is too large.

2. **Case `a < 8`**:
   - For `a = -1`, the sum is `> 6` (as above).
   - For `a < -1`, the expressions inside the square roots become negative, making the square roots undefined.

Thus, `a = 8` is the only solution.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Domain Analysis**:
   - Ensure all square roots are defined by checking the inequalities inside them.
   - Conclude that `a ≥ -1` is necessary.

2. **Guess the Solution**:
   - Test `a = 8` to see if it satisfies the equation.
   - Verify that the sum is `6` when `a = 8`.

3. **Uniqueness Check**:
   - For `a > 8`, the sum exceeds `6`.
   - For `a < 8`, the sum is either undefined or less than `6`.
   - Conclude that `a = 8` is the only solution.
