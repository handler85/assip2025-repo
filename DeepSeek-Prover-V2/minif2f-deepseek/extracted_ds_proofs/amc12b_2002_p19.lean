### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given three positive real numbers \(a, b, c\) and three equations:
1. \(a(b + c) = 152\),
2. \(b(c + a) = 162\),
3. \(c(a + b) = 170\).

We need to find \(abc = 720\).

#### Step 1: Expand the Given Equations

First, expand each of the given equations:
1. \(a(b + c) = ab + ac = 152\),
2. \(b(c + a) = bc + ba = 162\),
3. \(c(a + b) = ca + cb = 170\).

#### Step 2: Add All Three Equations

Add the three equations together:
\[
(ab + ac) + (bc + ba) + (ca + cb) = 152 + 162 + 170.
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 484.
\]
Factor out the 2:
\[
2(ab + ac + bc) = 484.
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
ab + ac + bc = 242.
\]

#### Step 3: Subtract the Original Equations

Now, subtract the first original equation from the second:
\[
(bc + ba) - (ab + ac) = 162 - 152.
\]
Simplify:
\[
bc + ba - ab - ac = 10.
\]
Factor:
\[
(bc - ac) + (ba - ab) = 10.
\]
\[
c(b - a) + a(b - a) = 10.
\]
Factor again:
\[
(b - a)(c + a) = 10.
\]
Similarly, subtract the second original equation from the third:
\[
(ca + cb) - (bc + ba) = 170 - 162.
\]
Simplify:
\[
ca + cb - bc - ba = 8.
\]
Factor:
\[
(ca - ba) + (cb - bc) = 8.
\]
\[
a(c - b) + b(c - b) = 8.
\]
Factor again:
\[
(c - b)(a + b) = 8.
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \(a, b, c\)

We now have:
1. \((b - a)(c + a) = 10\),
2. \((c - b)(a + b) = 8\),
3. \(ab + ac + bc = 242\).

Let's find \((c - a)(a + b + c)\).

First, note that:
\[
(c - a)(a + b + c) = (c - a)(a + b + c) = (c - a)(a + b + c).
\]
But we can also write:
\[
(c - a)(a + b + c) = (c - a)(a + b + c) = (c - a)(a + b + c).
\]
Alternatively, observe that:
\[
(c - a)(a + b + c) = (c - a)(a + b + c) = (c - a)(a + b + c).
\]
But a better approach is to use the given equations to find \((c - a)(a + b + c)\).

However, we can also find \((c - a)(a + b + c)\) by multiplying the first two equations:
\[
(b - a)(c + a) \cdot (c - b)(a + b) = 10 \cdot 8.
\]
But this seems complicated. Instead, let's try to find \(a, b, c\) directly.

#### Step 5: Assume Symmetry and Find a Solution

Assume \(a = b\). Then the first equation becomes:
\[
a(a + c) = 152 \implies a^2 + ac = 152.
\]
The second equation becomes:
\[
a(c + a) = 162 \implies a^2 + ac = 162.
\]
But \(a^2 + ac = 152\) and \(a^2 + ac = 162\) cannot both be true simultaneously. Hence, \(a \neq b\).

Similarly, assume \(b = c\). Then the first equation becomes:
\[
a(b + b) = 152 \implies 2ab = 152 \implies ab = 76.
\]
The second equation becomes:
\[
b(a + b) = 162 \implies ab + b^2 = 162.
\]
Substitute \(ab = 76\):
\[
76 + b^2 = 162 \implies b^2 = 86.
\]
The third equation becomes:
\[
c(a + b) = 170 \implies b(a + b) = 170.
\]
Substitute \(ab = 76\):
\[
76 + b^2 = 170 \implies b^2 = 94.
\]
But \(b^2 = 86\) and \(b^2 = 94\) cannot both be true simultaneously. Hence, \(b \neq c\).

#### Step 6: Find a Solution by Guessing

Assume \(a = 5\) and find \(b\) and \(c\):
1. \(5(b + c) = 152 \implies b + c = 30.4\),
2. \(b(c + 5) = 162\),
3. \(c(5 + b) = 170\).

From \(b + c = 30.4\), we have \(c = 30.4 - b\). Substitute into the second equation:
\[
b(30.4 - b + 5) = 162 \implies b(35.4 - b) = 162.
\]
Expand:
\[
35.4b - b^2 = 162.
\]
Rearrange:
\[
b^2 - 35.4b + 162 = 0.
\]
Solve the quadratic equation:
\[
b = \frac{35.4 \pm \sqrt{35.4^2 - 4 \cdot 162}}{2} = \frac{35.4 \pm \sqrt{1253.16 - 648}}{2} = \frac{35.4 \pm \sqrt{605.16}}{2}.
\]
\[
b = \frac{35.4 \pm 24.6}{2}.
\]
Thus, the two solutions are:
\[
b = \frac{35.4 + 24.6}{2} = 30, \quad b = \frac{35.4 - 24.6}{2} = 5.4.
\]
If \(b = 30\), then \(c = 30.4 - 30 = 0.4\).
If \(b = 5.4\), then \(c = 30.4 - 5.4 = 25\).

Now, check the third equation for each case:
1. If \(b = 30\) and \(c = 0.4\):
   \[
   c(5 + b) = 0.4 \cdot (5 + 30) = 0.4 \cdot 35 = 14 \neq 170.
   \]
2. If \(b = 5.4\) and \(c = 25\):
   \[
   c(5 + b) = 25 \cdot (5 + 5.4) = 25 \cdot 10.4 = 260 \neq 170.
   \]
Thus, \(a = 5\) does not work.

#### Step 7: Find a Solution by Trying Other Values

Assume \(a = 4\) and find \(b\) and \(c\):
1. \(4(b + c) = 152 \implies b + c = 38\),
2. \(b(c + 4) = 162\),
3. \(c(4 + b) = 170\).

From \(b + c = 38\), we have \(c = 38 - b\). Substitute into the second equation:
\[
b(38 - b + 4) = 162 \implies b(42 - b) = 162.
\]
Expand:
\[
42b - b^2 = 162.
\]
Rearrange:
\[
b^2 - 42b + 162 = 0.
\]
Solve the quadratic equation:
\[
b = \frac{42 \pm \sqrt{42^2 - 4 \cdot 162}}{2} = \frac{42 \pm \sqrt{1764 - 648}}{2} = \frac{42 \pm \sqrt{1116}}{2}.
\]
\[
b = \frac{42 \pm 33.4}{2}.
\]
Thus, the two solutions are:
\[
b = \frac{42 + 33.4}{2} = 37.7, \quad b = \frac{42 - 33.4}{2} = 4.3.
\]
If \(b = 37.7\), then \(c = 38 - 37.7 = 0.3\).
If \(b = 4.3\), then \(c = 38 - 4.3 = 33.7\).

Now, check the third equation for each case:
1. If \(b = 37.7\) and \(c = 0.3\):
   \[
   c(4 + b) = 0.3 \cdot (4 + 37.7) = 0.3 \cdot 41.7 = 12.51 \neq 170.
   \]
2. If \(b = 4.3\) and \(c = 33.7\):
   \[
   c(4 + b) = 33.7 \cdot (4 + 4.3) = 33.7 \cdot 8.3 = 280.31 \neq 170.
   \]
Thus, \(a = 4\) does not work.

#### Step 8: Find a Solution by Trying Other Values

Assume \(a = 6\) and find \(b\) and \(c\):
1. \(6(b + c) = 152 \implies b + c = 25.333\),
2. \(b(c + 6) = 162\),
3. \(c(6 + b) = 170\).

From \(b + c = 25.333\), we have \(c = 25.333 - b\). Substitute into the second equation:
\[
b(25.333 - b + 6) = 162 \implies b(31.333 - b) = 162.
\]
Expand:
\[
31.333b - b^2 = 162.
\]
Rearrange:
\[
b^2 - 31.333b + 162 = 0.
\]
Solve the quadratic equation:
\[
b = \frac{31.333 \pm \sqrt{31.333^2 - 4 \cdot 162}}{2} = \frac{31.333 \pm \sqrt{981.768889 - 648}}{2} = \frac{31.333 \pm \sqrt{333.768889}}{2}.
\]
\[
b = \frac{31.333 \pm 18.27}{2}.
\]
Thus, the two solutions are:
\[
b = \frac{31.333 + 18.27}{2} = 24.8015, \quad b = \frac{31.333 - 18.27}{2} = 6.5315.
\]
If \(b = 24.8015\), then \(c = 25.333 - 24.8015 = 0.5315\).
If \(b = 6.5315\), then \(c = 25.333 - 6.5315 = 18.8015\).

Now, check the third equation for each case:
1. If \(b = 24.8015\) and \(c = 0.5315\):
   \[
   c(6 + b) = 0.5315 \cdot (6 + 24.8015) = 0.5315 \cdot 30.8015 = 16.379 \neq 170.
   \]
2. If \(b = 6.5315\) and \(c = 18.8015\):
   \[
   c(6 + b) = 18.8015 \cdot (6 + 6.5315) = 18.8015 \cdot 12.5315 = 235.66 \neq 170.
   \]
Thus, \(a = 6\) does not work.

#### Step 9: Find a Solution by Trying Other Values

Assume \(a = 7\) and find \(b\) and \(c\):
1. \(7(b + c) = 152 \implies b + c = 21.714\),
2. \(b(c + 7) = 162\),
3. \(c(7 + b) = 170\).

From \(b + c = 21.714\), we have \(c = 21.714 - b\). Substitute into the second equation:
\[
b(21.714 - b + 7) = 162 \implies b(28.714 - b) = 162.
\]
Expand:
\[
28.714b - b^2 = 162.
\]
Rearrange:
\[
b^2 - 28.714b + 162 = 0.
\]
Solve the quadratic equation:
\[
b = \frac{28.714 \pm \sqrt{28.714^2 - 4 \cdot 162}}{2} = \frac{28.714 \pm \sqrt{824.507796 - 648}}{2} = \frac{28.714 \pm \sqrt{176.507796}}{2}.
\]
\[
b = \frac{28.714 \pm 13.285}{2}.
\]
Thus, the two solutions are:
\[
b = \frac{28.714 + 13.285}{2} = 20.9995, \quad b = \frac{28.714 - 13.285}{2} = 7.7145.
\]
If \(b = 20.9995\), then \(c = 21.714 - 20.9995 = 0.7145\).
If \(b = 7.7145\), then \(c = 21.714 - 7.7145 = 13.9995\).

Now, check the third equation for each case:
1. If \(b = 20.9995\) and \(c = 0.7145\):
   \[
   c(7 + b) = 0.7145 \cdot (7 + 20.9995) = 0.7145 \cdot 27.9995 = 19.999 \neq 170.
   \]
2. If \(b = 7.7145\) and \(c = 13.9995\):
   \[
   c(7 + b) = 13.9995 \cdot (7 + 7.7145) = 13.9995 \cdot 14.7145 = 205.71 \neq 170.
   \]
Thus, \(a = 7\) does not work.

#### Step 10: Find a Solution by Trying Other Values

Assume \(a = 8\) and find \(b\) and \(c\):
1. \(8(b + c) = 152 \implies b + c = 19\),
2. \(b(c + 8) = 162\),
3. \(c(8 + b) = 170\).

From \(b + c = 19\), we have \(c = 19 - b\). Substitute into the second equation:
\[
b(19 - b + 8) = 162 \implies b(27 - b) = 162.
\]
Expand:
\[
27b - b^2 = 162.
\]
Rearrange:
\[
b^2 - 27b + 162 = 0.
\]
Solve the quadratic equation:
\[
b = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{27^2 - 4 \cdot 162}}{2} = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{729 - 648}}{2} = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} = \frac{27 \pm 9}{2}.
\]
Thus, the two solutions are:
\[
b = \frac{27 + 9}{2} = 18, \quad b = \frac{27 - 9}{2} = 9.
\]
If \(b = 18\), then \(c = 19 - 18 = 1\).
If \(b = 9\), then \(c = 19 - 9 = 10\).

Now, check the third equation for each case:
1. If \(b = 18\) and \(c = 1\):
   \[
   c(8 + b) = 1 \cdot (8 + 18) = 1 \cdot 26 = 26 \neq 170.
   \]
2. If \(b = 9\) and \(c = 10\):
   \[
   c(8 + b) = 10 \cdot (8 + 9) = 10 \cdot 17 = 170.
   \]
Thus, \(a = 8\) and \(b = 9\), \(c = 10\) is a solution.

#### Step 11: Verify the Solution

Substitute \(a = 8\), \(b = 9\), \(c = 10\) into the original equations:
1. \(a(b + c) = 8 \cdot (9 + 10) = 8 \cdot 19 = 152\),
2. \(b(c + a) = 9 \cdot (10 + 8) = 9 \cdot 18 = 162\),
3. \(c(a + b) = 10 \cdot (8 + 9) = 10 \cdot 17 = 170\).

All three equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given three equations involving three variables \(a, b, c\) and need to find their values.

2. **Attempt to Solve by Guessing**: Since the equations are nonlinear, we cannot solve them directly by simple algebraic manipulation. We can try to find integer solutions by guessing values for one variable and solving for the others.

3. **Test Possible Values**: We test values for \(a\) and solve for \(b\) and \(c\) using the equations. We find that \(a = 8\) gives \(b = 9\) and \(c = 10\) as a solution.

4. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \(a = 8\), \(b = 9\), \(c = 10\) back into the original equations to ensure they are satisfied.
