### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the sum of the first 12 positive integers and then determine its modulo 4 remainder.

1. **Sum of the first 12 positive integers**:
   The sum of the first `n` positive integers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   For `n = 12`:
   \[
   S = \frac{12 \times 13}{2} = 6 \times 13 = 78
   \]

2. **Modulo 4 remainder of 78**:
   We need to find `78 mod 4`.
   - `4 * 19 = 76`
   - `78 - 76 = 2`
   - Therefore, `78 mod 4 = 2`.

Alternatively, we can directly compute `78 mod 4` by observing that `78 = 4 * 19 + 2`, so the remainder is `2`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Calculate the sum of the first 12 positive integers**:
   - Use the formula for the sum of the first `n` positive integers: `n(n + 1)/2`.
   - Substitute `n = 12` to get `78`.

2. **Find the remainder when `78` is divided by `4`**:
   - Compute `78 mod 4` by noting that `78 = 4 * 19 + 2`, so the remainder is `2`.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_239 :
  (∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 12, k) % 4 = 2 := by
  have h_sum : (∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 12, k) = 78 := by sorry
  have h_mod : 78 % 4 = 2 := by sorry
  have h_final : (∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 12, k) % 4 = 2 := by sorry
  exact h_final
```
