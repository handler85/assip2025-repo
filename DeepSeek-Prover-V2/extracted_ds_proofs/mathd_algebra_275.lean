### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We have:
1. `((11:ℝ)^(1 / 4))^(3 * x - 3) = 1 / 5`
2. We need to find `((11:ℝ)^(1 / 4))^(6 * x + 2) = 121 / 25`

But wait, there's a misunderstanding here. The notation `(11:ℝ)^(1 / 4)` is not standard. In Lean, `(11:ℝ)^(1 / 4)` is interpreted as `(11:ℝ)^(Nat.div 1 4) = (11:ℝ)^0 = 1` because `1 / 4 = 0` in integer division. 

But in the problem, `(11:ℝ)^(1 / 4)` is `(11:ℝ)^(0) = 1` because `1 / 4 = 0` in integer division. 

Thus, the hypothesis simplifies to `1 ^ (3 * x - 3) = 1 / 5`, i.e., `1 = 1 / 5`, which is false. 

But Lean's `1 / 4` is `0` because it's `Nat.div`, and `(11:ℝ)^0 = 1`.
