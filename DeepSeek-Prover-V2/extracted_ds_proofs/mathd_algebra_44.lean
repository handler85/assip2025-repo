### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have two equations:
1. \( s = 9 - 2t \)
2. \( t = 3s + 1 \)

We need to find the values of \( s \) and \( t \) that satisfy both equations simultaneously. The solution is claimed to be \( s = 1 \) and \( t = 4 \).

**Approach:**
To find \( s \) and \( t \), we can substitute the expression for \( s \) from the first equation into the second equation. This will allow us to solve for \( t \), and then substitute back to find \( s \).

**Detailed Solution:**

1. Start with the second equation:
   \[ t = 3s + 1 \]

2. Substitute \( s = 9 - 2t \) into the second equation:
   \[ t = 3(9 - 2t) + 1 \]

3. Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[ t = 27 - 6t + 1 \]
   \[ t = 28 - 6t \]

4. Add \( 6t \) to both sides:
   \[ t + 6t = 28 \]
   \[ 7t = 28 \]

5. Divide both sides by 7:
   \[ t = \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

6. Substitute \( t = 4 \) back into the first equation to find \( s \):
   \[ s = 9 - 2t = 9 - 2 \cdot 4 = 9 - 8 = 1 \]

Thus, the solution is \( s = 1 \) and \( t = 4 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Substitute the expression for \( s \) into the second equation**:
   - Use \( s = 9 - 2t \) to replace \( s \) in \( t = 3s + 1 \).

2. **Solve for \( t \)**:
   - Expand and simplify the equation to find \( t \).

3. **Find \( s \) using the value of \( t \)**:
   - Substitute \( t \) back into the expression for \( s \) to find \( s \).

4. **Verify the solution**:
   - Check that both original equations are satisfied with \( s = 1 \) and \( t = 4 \).
