### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given four rational numbers \(a, b, c, d\) and four equations:
1. \(3a = b + c + d\)
2. \(4b = a + c + d\)
3. \(2c = a + b + d\)
4. \(8a + 10b + 6c = 24\)

We need to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of \(d\) when \(d\) is expressed in its simplest form as a fraction. The goal is to prove that this sum is \(28\).

#### Step 1: Subtract the first equation from the second
Subtract \(3a = b + c + d\) from \(4b = a + c + d\):
\[ 4b - 3a = (a + c + d) - (b + c + d) \]
\[ 4b - 3a = a - b \]
\[ 4b - 3a - a + b = 0 \]
\[ 5b - 4a = 0 \]
\[ 5b = 4a \]
\[ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{5}{4} \]

#### Step 2: Subtract the second equation from the third
Subtract \(4b = a + c + d\) from \(2c = a + b + d\):
\[ 2c - 4b = (a + b + d) - (a + c + d) \]
\[ 2c - 4b = b - c \]
\[ 2c - 4b - b + c = 0 \]
\[ 3c - 5b = 0 \]
\[ 3c = 5b \]
\[ \frac{b}{c} = \frac{3}{5} \]

#### Step 3: Subtract the third equation from the first
Subtract \(2c = a + b + d\) from \(3a = b + c + d\):
\[ 3a - 2c = (b + c + d) - (a + b + d) \]
\[ 3a - 2c = c - a \]
\[ 3a - 2c - c + a = 0 \]
\[ 4a - 3c = 0 \]
\[ 4a = 3c \]
\[ \frac{a}{c} = \frac{3}{4} \]

#### Step 4: Find the relationship between \(a, b, c\)
From \(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{5}{4}\), we get \(a = \frac{5}{4}b\).
From \(\frac{b}{c} = \frac{3}{5}\), we get \(c = \frac{5}{3}b\).
From \(\frac{a}{c} = \frac{3}{4}\), we get \(a = \frac{3}{4}c = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{3}b = \frac{5}{4}b\), which is consistent.

#### Step 5: Substitute \(a\) and \(c\) into the fourth equation
The fourth equation is:
\[ 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \]
Substitute \(a = \frac{5}{4}b\) and \(c = \frac{5}{3}b\):
\[ 8 \cdot \frac{5}{4}b + 10b + 6 \cdot \frac{5}{3}b = 24 \]
\[ 10b + 10b + 10b = 24 \]
\[ 30b = 24 \]
\[ b = \frac{24}{30} = \frac{4}{5} \]

#### Step 6: Find \(a\) and \(c\)
\[ a = \frac{5}{4}b = \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = 1 \]
\[ c = \frac{5}{3}b = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{3} \]

#### Step 7: Find \(d\)
From \(3a = b + c + d\):
\[ 3 \cdot 1 = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{3} + d \]
\[ 3 = \frac{12}{15} + \frac{20}{15} + d \]
\[ 3 = \frac{32}{15} + d \]
\[ d = 3 - \frac{32}{15} = \frac{45}{15} - \frac{32}{15} = \frac{13}{15} \]

#### Step 8: Find the sum of the numerator and denominator of \(d\)
The fraction \(d = \frac{13}{15}\) is already in simplest form, so the numerator is \(13\) and the denominator is \(15\). The sum is \(13 + 15 = 28\).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Find Relationships Between Variables**:
   - Subtract the first equation from the second to find \(\frac{a}{b} = \frac{5}{4}\).
   - Subtract the second equation from the third to find \(\frac{b}{c} = \frac{3}{5}\).
   - Subtract the third equation from the first to find \(\frac{a}{c} = \frac{3}{4}\).

2. **Find Expressions for Variables**:
   - Use the relationships to express \(a\) in terms of \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of \(b\).

3. **Find the Value of \(b\)**:
   - Substitute the expressions for \(a\) and \(c\) into the fourth equation to find \(b\).

4. **Find the Values of \(a\) and \(c\)**:
   - Use the value of \(b\) to find \(a\) and \(c\).

5. **Find the Value of \(d\)**:
   - Use the value of \(a\) to find \(d\) by substituting into the first equation.

6. **Find the Sum of the Numerator and Denominator of \(d\)**:
   - Simplify \(d\) to its lowest terms and add the numerator and denominator.
