### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
We are given `n = 11` and we need to compute `(1 / 4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n)` and show that it equals `1 / 4`.

However, there is a critical issue with the Lean 4 statement:
The expression `(1 / 4)^(n + 1)` is interpreted as `(1 / 4) ^ (n + 1)` in Lean, where `1 / 4` is a natural number division. In Lean, `1 / 4 = 0` because `1 < 4`, so `(1 / 4)^(n + 1) = 0^(n + 1)`.

But `0^(n + 1)` is `0` when `n + 1 > 0`, i.e., for all `n ≥ 0` (since `n : ℕ`). 

Thus, `(1 / 4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n) = 0 * 2^(2 * n) = 0`. 

But the Lean 4 statement claims the result is `1 / 4`, i.e., `0`, which is incorrect. 

However, the Lean 4 statement is `(1 / 4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n) = 1 / 4`, and `1 / 4` is `0` in Lean. 

Thus, the statement is `0 = 0`, which is true. 

But the confusion arises because `(1 / 4)^(n + 1)` is `0` and `2^(2 * n)` is `2^22` (`n = 11`), but `0 * 2^22 = 0` is `1 / 4` (`0`). 

Thus, the statement is correct, but the proof is trivial because `1 / 4 = 0` in Lean.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand Lean's `/` for `Nat`:**
   - In Lean, `1 / 4 = 0` because `1 < 4`.
   - Therefore, `(1 / 4)^(n + 1) = 0^(n + 1) = 0` (since `n + 1 ≥ 1`).

2. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - The original expression becomes `0 * 2^(2 * n) = 0`.
   - But `1 / 4 = 0` in Lean, so the goal is `0 = 0`, which is true.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The proof is straightforward because all terms simplify to `0` in Lean.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_algebra_314
  (n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : n = 11) :
  (1 / 4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n) = 1 / 4 := by
  have h_main : (1 / 4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n) = 0 := by
    sorry
  have h_final : (1 / 4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n) = 1 / 4 := by
    sorry
  exact h_final
```

### Explanation:
1. `h_main`: We first prove that `(1 / 4)^(n + 1) * 2^(2 * n) = 0` because `1 / 4 = 0` in Lean, and any product with `0` is `0`.
2. `h_final`: We then prove that `0 = 1 / 4` in Lean, which is true because `1 / 4 = 0` in Lean.
3. The `exact` statement uses `h_final` to complete the proof.
