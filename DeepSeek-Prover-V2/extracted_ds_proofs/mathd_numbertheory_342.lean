### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall that the **modulus** (or **remainder**) of `a` divided by `b` is the unique integer `r` such that:
1. `0 ≤ r < b`, and
2. `a = b * q + r` for some integer `q` (the **quotient**).

In Lean, `a % b` is defined as the remainder `r` when `a` is divided by `b` (with the same properties as above).

**Given:** `54 % 6 = 0`

**Proof:**
1. We need to find the quotient `q` and remainder `r` when `54` is divided by `6`.
   - `54 = 6 * 9 + 0` because `6 * 9 = 54` and `0 ≤ 0 < 6`.
   - Here, `q = 9` and `r = 0`.
2. By definition, `54 % 6 = r = 0`.

Alternatively, we can use the property that `a % b = 0` if and only if `b` divides `a` (`b ∣ a`). Here, `6 ∣ 54` because `54 = 6 * 9`, so `54 % 6 = 0` is trivially true.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the problem:** We need to find the remainder when `54` is divided by `6`, and show that it is `0`.
2. **Find the quotient and remainder:**
   - `54 = 6 * 9 + 0` because `6 * 9 = 54` and `0 ≤ 0 < 6`.
   - The remainder is `0`.
3. **Conclusion:** `54 % 6 = 0`.
