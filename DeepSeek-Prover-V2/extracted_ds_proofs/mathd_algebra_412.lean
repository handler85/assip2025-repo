### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that:
1. \( x + y = 25 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( x - y = 11 \) (Equation 2)

We need to find the value of \( x \).

**Approach:**
We can solve this system of linear equations for \( x \) and \( y \) in two ways:
1. **Substitution Method**: Solve one equation for one variable and substitute it into the other equation.
2. **Elimination Method**: Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable.

Here, we will use the **elimination method** to find \( x \).

**Step 1: Add the two equations to eliminate \( y \).**

Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:
\[
(x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
2x = 36
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = 18
\]

**Verification:**
Substitute \( x = 18 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
\[
18 + y = 25 \implies y = 7
\]
Check in Equation 2:
\[
18 - 7 = 11 \quad \checkmark
\]
Thus, the solution is correct.

### Step 2: Abstract Plan

1. **Add the two given equations to eliminate \( y \):**
   - \( (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11 \)
   - Simplify to \( 2x = 36 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 2 to get \( x = 18 \).

3. **Verify the solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 18 \) back into one of the original equations to find \( y \).
   - Check that both original equations are satisfied with \( x = 18 \) and \( y = 7 \).
