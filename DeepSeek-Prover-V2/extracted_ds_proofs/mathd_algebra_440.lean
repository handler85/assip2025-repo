### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given the equation:
\[ \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{3} = \frac{x}{10} \]

We need to solve for \( x \).

#### Step 1: Simplify the Left Side
The left side is a fraction of fractions. We can simplify it as follows:
\[ \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{3} = \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10} \]

#### Step 2: Cross-Multiply to Solve for \( x \)
Multiply both sides by 10:
\[ 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = x \]
\[ 5 = x \]

Thus, \( x = 5 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the Left Side**:
   - Compute \( \frac{3}{2} \div 3 \) as \( \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \).
   - Simplify the product to get \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The equation becomes \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10} \).

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Cross-multiply to get \( 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = x \).
   - Simplify to \( 5 = x \).
