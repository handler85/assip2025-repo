### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's carefully restate the problem and understand the given conditions and goal.

**Problem Statement:**
We have two classes:
1. Morning class with `m` students, mean score `84`.
2. Afternoon class with `a` students, mean score `70`.

The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is `3/4`, i.e., `m / a = 3 / 4` (as a real number).

We need to find the mean score of all students, i.e., `(84 * m + 70 * a) / (m + a)`, and show that it is `76`.

**Assumptions:**
1. `m` and `a` are positive integers (`0 < m` and `0 < a`).
2. The ratio `m / a` is given as a real number `3 / 4` (`↑m / ↑a = (3 : ℝ) / 4`).

**Goal:**
Prove that `(84 * m + 70 * a) / (m + a) = 76` (as a real number).

**Approach:**
1. From `↑m / ↑a = (3 : ℝ) / 4`, we can deduce that `4 * m = 3 * a` (since `a ≠ 0` and `m ≠ 0`).
   - This is because multiplying both sides by `4 * a` (which is `≠ 0` because `a > 0` and `m > 0`) gives `4 * m * a = 3 * a * a`, i.e., `4 * m * a = 3 * a²`.
   - But we can simplify this to `4 * m = 3 * a` by dividing both sides by `a` (since `a > 0`).
   - Alternatively, we can directly cross-multiply to get `4 * m = 3 * a`.

2. Substitute `4 * m = 3 * a` into the numerator `84 * m + 70 * a` and the denominator `m + a` to simplify the expression.

3. Compute the ratio `(84 * m + 70 * a) / (m + a)`:
   - Numerator: `84 * m + 70 * a = 84 * m + 70 * a = 84 * (3 * a / 4) + 70 * a = 63 * a + 70 * a = 133 * a`.
   - Denominator: `m + a = (3 * a / 4) + a = 3 * a / 4 + 4 * a / 4 = 7 * a / 4`.
   - Ratio: `(133 * a) / (7 * a / 4) = (133 * a) * (4 / (7 * a)) = (133 * 4) / 7 = 532 / 7 = 76`.

But wait, there's a mistake in the above calculation! The denominator is `m + a = 3 * a / 4 + a = 3 * a / 4 + 4 * a / 4 = 7 * a / 4`, which is correct. The numerator is `84 * m + 70 * a = 84 * (3 * a / 4) + 70 * a = 63 * a + 70 * a = 133 * a`, which is also correct. So the ratio is `(133 * a) / (7 * a / 4) = (133 * 4) / 7 = 532 / 7 = 76`.

But wait, `84 * m = 84 * (3 * a / 4) = 63 * a`, not `63 * a + 70 * a = 133 * a`! There's a mistake in the earlier calculation. The correct numerator is `84 * m + 70 * a = 63 * a + 70 * a = 133 * a`, which is correct. The denominator is `m + a = 3 * a / 4 + a = 7 * a / 4`, which is also correct. So the ratio is `(133 * a) / (7 * a / 4) = (133 * 4) / 7 = 532 / 7 = 76`.

Thus, the mean score of all students is `76`.

### Step 1: Prove `4 * m = 3 * a`

From `↑m / ↑a = (3 : ℝ) / 4`, we can cross-multiply to get `4 * m = 3 * a`.

### Step 2: Substitute `4 * m = 3 * a` into the expression for the mean

The numerator is `84 * m + 70 * a = 84 * m + 70 * a = 84 * (3 * a / 4) + 70 * a = 63 * a + 70 * a = 133 * a`.

The denominator is `m + a = (3 * a / 4) + a = 3 * a / 4 + 4 * a / 4 = 7 * a / 4`.

Thus, the mean is `(133 * a) / (7 * a / 4) = (133 * 4) / 7 = 532 / 7 = 76`.

### Step 3: Abstract Plan

1. **Prove `4 * m = 3 * a`:**
   - Cross-multiply the given ratio `↑m / ↑a = (3 : ℝ) / 4` to get `4 * m = 3 * a`.

2. **Substitute `4 * m = 3 * a` into the mean expression:**
   - Compute `84 * m + 70 * a = 133 * a`.
   - Compute `m + a = 7 * a / 4`.
   - Compute the mean as `(133 * a) / (7 * a / 4) = 76`.
