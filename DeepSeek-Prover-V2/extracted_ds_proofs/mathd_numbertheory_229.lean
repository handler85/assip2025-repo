### Detailed Proof

**Problem:** Find the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, i.e., \(5^{30} \mod 7\).

**Approach:** We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but a simpler approach is to find the pattern of powers of 5 modulo 7.

1. Compute the first few powers of 5 modulo 7:
   - \(5^1 \equiv 5 \mod 7\)
   - \(5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 4 \mod 7\)
   - \(5^3 \equiv 5 \cdot 4 \equiv 20 \equiv 6 \mod 7\)
   - \(5^4 \equiv 5 \cdot 6 \equiv 30 \equiv 2 \mod 7\)
   - \(5^5 \equiv 5 \cdot 2 \equiv 10 \equiv 3 \mod 7\)
   - \(5^6 \equiv 5 \cdot 3 \equiv 15 \equiv 1 \mod 7\)

2. Observe that \(5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\). This means that the powers of 5 modulo 7 cycle every 6 steps.

3. To find \(5^{30} \mod 7\), we can use the fact that \(5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\) and \(30 = 6 \cdot 5\). Therefore:
   \[
   5^{30} = (5^6)^5 \equiv 1^5 \equiv 1 \mod 7.
   \]

**Conclusion:** The remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find \(5^{30} \mod 7\).

2. **Find the Pattern of Powers of 5 Modulo 7:**
   - Compute \(5^1 \mod 7\), \(5^2 \mod 7\), ..., until a cycle is detected.

3. **Identify the Cycle:**
   - After computing several powers, observe that \(5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\).

4. **Use the Cycle to Simplify \(5^{30} \mod 7\):**
   - Since \(30 = 6 \cdot 5\), we have \(5^{30} = (5^6)^5 \equiv 1^5 \equiv 1 \mod 7\).

5. **Conclude the Proof:**
   - The remainder is 1.
