### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. The Lean 4 statement is:
```lean4
theorem algebra_ineq_nto1onlt2m1on
  (n : ℕ) :
  n^(1 / n) < 2 - 1 / n := by
```
Here, `n^(1 / n)` is interpreted as `n` raised to the power of `1 / n` (where `/` is integer division). The expression `2 - 1 / n` is also interpreted as `2 - (1 / n)` (where `/` is integer division).

However, there is a problem with this interpretation:
1. For `n = 0`, `1 / n` is `0` (Lean's `Nat` division by zero is `0`), so `2 - 1 / n = 2 - 0 = 2`. But `n^(1 / n) = 0^0 = 1` (Lean's `Nat` defines `0^0 = 1`). So `1 < 2` is true.
2. For `n = 1`, `1 / n = 1`, so `2 - 1 / n = 2 - 1 = 1`. And `n^(1 / n) = 1^1 = 1`. So `1 < 1` is false. But Lean's `n^(1 / n)` is `1^1 = 1` and `2 - 1 / n` is `2 - 1 = 1`, so `1 < 1` is false. The statement is false for `n = 1`.

But wait, the Lean 4 statement is `n^(1 / n) < 2 - 1 / n`, and for `n = 1`, `n^(1 / n) = 1` and `2 - 1 / n = 1`, so `1 < 1` is false. The statement is false for `n = 1`.

But the Lean 4 code is:
```lean4
theorem algebra_ineq_nto1onlt2m1on
  (n : ℕ) :
  n^(1 / n) < 2 - 1 / n := by
```
This is a false statement because it is false for `n = 1`. 

But wait, is `2 - 1 / n` interpreted as `2 - (1 / n)`? Yes, because `/` is left-associative in Lean. 

But for `n = 1`, `1 / n = 1`, so `2 - 1 / n = 2 - 1 = 1`, and `n^(1 / n) = 1^1 = 1`, so `1 < 1` is false. 

Thus, the statement is false for `n = 1`, and hence the Lean 4 statement is false. 

But the Lean 4 code is:
```lean4
theorem algebra_ineq_nto1onlt2m1on
  (n : ℕ) :
  n^(1 / n) < 2 - 1 / n := by
