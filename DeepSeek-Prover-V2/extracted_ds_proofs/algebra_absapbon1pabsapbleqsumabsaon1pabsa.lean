### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We need to prove that for any real numbers \( a \) and \( b \),
\[
\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}.
\]
The denominators \( 1 + |a + b| \), \( 1 + |a| \), and \( 1 + |b| \) are all positive, so the inequality is well-defined.

**Key Observations:**
1. The function \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + x} \) is increasing for \( x \geq 0 \). This is because its derivative \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2} > 0 \) for \( x \geq 0 \).
2. The inequality can be rewritten using the function \( f \):
   \[
   f(|a + b|) \leq f(|a|) + f(|b|).
   \]
   However, this is not directly helpful because \( f(|a + b|) \leq f(|a|) + f(|b|) \) is not true in general (e.g., take \( a = b = 1 \), then \( f(2) = \frac{2}{3} \leq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \), which is true, but take \( a = 1, b = -1 \), then \( f(0) = 0 \leq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \), which is true).

   But we can instead use the fact that \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + x} \) is concave for \( x \geq 0 \), i.e., \( f(tx + (1 - t)y) \geq tf(x) + (1 - t)f(y) \) for \( t \in [0, 1] \). However, this is not true for \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + x} \), as can be seen by taking \( x = 0, y = 1, t = \frac{1}{2} \), then \( f(tx + (1 - t)y) = f(0.5) = \frac{1}{3} \), while \( tf(x) + (1 - t)f(y) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \). So \( \frac{1}{3} \geq \frac{1}{4} \) is true, but the inequality is not in the right direction.

   Alternatively, we can use the fact that \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + x} \) is increasing and convex for \( x \geq 0 \). But we can also use the following approach:

3. The inequality can be proven by showing that:
   \[
   |a + b| \leq |a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|).
   \]
   This is because:
   \[
   \frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|)}{(1 + |a|)(1 + |b|)} = \frac{|a| + |a||b| + |b| + |a||b|}{(1 + |a|)(1 + |b|)} = \frac{|a| + |b| + 2|a||b|}{1 + |a| + |b| + |a||b|}.
   \]
   However, this is not directly helpful, and we need a better approach.

**Better Approach:**
We can use the fact that \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + x} \) is increasing and convex for \( x \geq 0 \). However, we can also use the following direct approach:

1. We know that \( |a + b| \leq |a| + |b| \).
2. We can write:
   \[
   \frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a| + |b|}{1 + |a| + |b|}.
   \]
   But this is not directly helpful.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that:
\[
\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a| + |b|}{2 + |a| + |b|}.
\]
But this is also not directly helpful.

**Final Approach:**
We can use the fact that:
\[
\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}
\]
is equivalent to:
\[
|a + b| \leq |a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|).
\]
But this is true because:
\[
|a + b| \leq |a| + |b| \leq |a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|).
\]

### Step 1: Prove \( |a + b| \leq |a| + |b| \).

This is the triangle inequality for real numbers.

### Step 2: Prove \( |a| + |b| \leq |a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|) \).

This is equivalent to:
\[
|a| + |b| \leq |a| + |a||b| + |b| + |a||b|
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
0 \leq 2|a||b|
\]
which is true because \( |a| \geq 0 \) and \( |b| \geq 0 \).

### Step 3: Combine the inequalities.

Since \( |a + b| \leq |a| + |b| \leq |a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|) \), we have:
\[
|a + b| \leq |a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|).
\]
Dividing both sides by \( 1 + |a + b| \geq 0 \) gives:
\[
\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|)}{(1 + |a|)(1 + |b|)} = \frac{|a| + |a||b| + |b| + |a||b|}{(1 + |a|)(1 + |b|)} = \frac{|a| + |b| + 2|a||b|}{1 + |a| + |b| + |a||b|}.
\]
But this is not directly helpful. Instead, we can directly use the fact that:
\[
\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a| + |b|}{1 + |a| + |b|},
\]
and then use the fact that:
\[
\frac{|a| + |b|}{1 + |a| + |b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}.
\]
The first inequality is true because \( |a + b| \leq |a| + |b| \), and the second inequality is true because:
\[
\frac{|a| + |b|}{1 + |a| + |b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}
\]
is equivalent to:
\[
|a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|) \leq (|a| + |b|)(1 + |a| + |b|),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
|a| + |a||b| + |b| + |a||b| \leq |a| + |a||b| + |a||b| + |a||b| + |b| + |b||b|,
\]
which further simplifies to:
\[
0 \leq |a||b| + |b||b|,
\]
which is true because \( |a| \geq 0 \), \( |b| \geq 0 \), and \( |b||b| \geq 0 \).

### Step 4: Combine all inequalities.

We have:
\[
\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a| + |b|}{1 + |a| + |b|}.
\]
And:
\[
\frac{|a| + |b|}{1 + |a| + |b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}.
\]
Therefore:
\[
\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}.
\]

### Abstract Plan

1. **Prove \( |a + b| \leq |a| + |b| \)**:
   - This is the triangle inequality for real numbers.

2. **Prove \( |a| + |b| \leq |a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|) \)**:
   - This simplifies to \( 0 \leq 2|a||b| \), which is true because \( |a| \geq 0 \) and \( |b| \geq 0 \).

3. **Combine the inequalities**:
   - Use the transitive property to conclude \( |a + b| \leq |a|(1 + |b|) + |b|(1 + |a|) \).
   - Divide both sides by \( 1 + |a + b| \geq 0 \) to get the desired inequality.
