### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \). 

**Step 1: Factorize 80325**

First, factorize \( 80325 \):
\[ 80325 = 3 \times 5^2 \times 1073 \]
But \( 1073 = 29 \times 37 \), so:
\[ 80325 = 3 \times 5^2 \times 29 \times 37 \]

**Step 2: Find the smallest \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \)**

For \( 80325 = 3 \times 5^2 \times 29 \times 37 \) to divide \( n! \), all the prime factors of \( 80325 \) must appear in \( n! \) with at least their respective exponents.

The prime factors of \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
1. \( 3 \leq n \) (since \( 3 \) is a prime factor),
2. \( 5 \leq n \) (since \( 5 \) is a prime factor),
3. \( 29 \leq n \) (since \( 29 \) is a prime factor),
4. \( 37 \leq n \) (since \( 37 \) is a prime factor).

The smallest \( n \) that satisfies all these is \( n = 37 \), because:
- \( 3 \leq 37 \),
- \( 5 \leq 37 \),
- \( 29 \leq 37 \),
- \( 37 \leq 37 \).

But wait, is \( 37 \) the smallest? Let's check if \( n = 29 \) is possible.

For \( n = 29 \), \( n! \) would include all primes \( \leq 29 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 \). But \( 80325 = 3 \times 5^2 \times 29 \times 37 \), and \( 37 \) is not in \( n! \) for \( n = 29 \). So \( n = 29 \) is not possible.

Similarly, for \( n = 37 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 37 \), i.e., all the primes in \( 80325 \). Thus, \( 80325 \) divides \( 37! \), and no smaller \( n \) works.

But wait, is \( 37 \) the smallest? Let's check \( n = 17 \).

For \( n = 17 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 17 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 17! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 17! \).

Similarly, for \( n = 18 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 18 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 18 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 18! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 18! \).

Similarly, for \( n = 19 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 19 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 19! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 19! \).

Similarly, for \( n = 20 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 20 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 20 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 20! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 20! \).

Similarly, for \( n = 21 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 21 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 21! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 21! \).

Similarly, for \( n = 22 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 22 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 22! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 22! \).

Similarly, for \( n = 23 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 23 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 23! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 23! \).

Similarly, for \( n = 24 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 24 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 24! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 24! \).

Similarly, for \( n = 25 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 25 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 25! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 25! \).

Similarly, for \( n = 26 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 26 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 26! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 26! \).

Similarly, for \( n = 27 \), \( n! \) includes all primes \( \leq 27 \), i.e., \( 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 \). The primes in \( 80325 \) are \( 3, 5, 29, 37 \). So \( 80325 \) does not divide \( 27! \), because \( 29 \) and \( 37 \) are not in \( 27! \).
