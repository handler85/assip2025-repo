### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's carefully restate the problem and understand the hypotheses and the goal.

**Problem Statement:**
Let \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \) be a function such that for every positive integer \( n \), we have:
1. \( f(n + 1) > f(f(n)) \).

Prove that \( f(n) = n \) for every positive integer \( n \).

**Observations:**
1. The condition \( f(n + 1) > f(f(n)) \) is very strong. It implies that \( f \) is strictly increasing in a very specific way.
2. The codomain of \( f \) is \( \mathbb{N}^+ \), so \( f(n) \geq 1 \) for all \( n \).
3. The condition is given for all \( n \geq 1 \), so we can start with \( n = 1 \), \( n = 2 \), etc.

**Approach:**
We will try to prove by induction that \( f(n) = n \) for all \( n \geq 1 \).

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
We need to show \( f(1) = 1 \).

From the condition for \( n = 1 \), we have:
\[ f(2) > f(f(1)) = f(1) = f(1). \]
But \( f(2) > f(1) \) is trivially true because \( f(2) \geq 1 \) and \( f(1) \geq 1 \), and \( f(2) > f(1) \) is possible if \( f(2) \geq f(1) + 1 \). However, we don't have any direct information about \( f(2) \), so this is not immediately helpful.

But wait, we have \( f(1) \geq 1 \) by hypothesis, and \( f(2) \geq 1 \). The condition is \( f(2) > f(f(1)) = f(1) \). So \( f(2) \geq f(1) + 1 \).

But we can also consider \( n = 2 \). The condition is:
\[ f(3) > f(f(2)) = f(2). \]
This means \( f(3) \geq f(2) + 1 \).

Similarly, for \( n = 3 \), we get:
\[ f(4) > f(f(3)) = f(3) \geq f(2) + 1. \]

This seems to be a pattern where \( f(n) \geq f(n - 1) + 1 \). But we can also think of \( f \) as strictly increasing.

But we need to prove \( f(n) = n \). 

**Inductive Hypothesis:**
Assume that for all \( k \leq n \), \( f(k) = k \).

**Inductive Step:**
We need to show that \( f(n + 1) = n + 1 \).

From the condition for \( n \), we have:
\[ f(n + 1) > f(f(n)) = f(n) = n. \]

But we also have \( f(n + 1) \leq n + 1 \) because \( f(n + 1) \geq 1 \).

But we need to show \( f(n + 1) = n + 1 \). 

But from the condition for \( n + 1 \), we have:
\[ f(n + 2) > f(f(n + 1)) = f(f(n + 1)) = f(n + 1). \]

But we can also use the fact that \( f \) is strictly increasing. 

But we need to prove \( f(n) = n \). 

Alternatively, we can use the fact that \( f \) is injective and \( f(n) \geq n \) to get \( f(n) = n \).

But we can also use the fact that \( f(n) \geq n \) and \( f(n) \leq n \) to get \( f(n) = n \).
