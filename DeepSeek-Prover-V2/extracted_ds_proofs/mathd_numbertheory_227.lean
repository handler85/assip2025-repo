### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's carefully restate the problem in a more familiar form. We have positive integers \( x, y, n \) (i.e., \( x, y, n \geq 1 \)) and the following equation holds in the real numbers:
\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}.
\]
We need to prove that \( n = 5 \).

#### Step 1: Cross-Multiply to Eliminate Denominators
Multiply both sides by \( 12n \) (the least common multiple of \( 4, 6, n \)) to eliminate denominators:
\[
12n \cdot \left( \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} \right) = 12n \cdot \frac{x + y}{n}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3n x + 2n y = 12 (x + y).
\]

#### Step 2: Rearrange the Equation
Bring all terms to one side:
\[
3n x + 2n y - 12 x - 12 y = 0.
\]
Factor out common terms:
\[
(3n - 12) x + (2n - 12) y = 0.
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( n \)
Since \( x, y \geq 1 \), the only way the above equation can hold is if the coefficients of \( x \) and \( y \) are zero. However, this is not possible because \( n \geq 1 \), and the coefficients are linear in \( n \). 

But wait, this is incorrect reasoning. The equation is:
\[
(3n - 12) x + (2n - 12) y = 0.
\]
Since \( x, y \geq 1 \), the left-hand side is at least:
\[
(3n - 12) \cdot 1 + (2n - 12) \cdot 1 = 5n - 24.
\]
For \( n \geq 1 \), \( 5n - 24 \geq -19 \), but this is not directly helpful. 

Instead, let's consider the equation modulo \( x \). The equation is:
\[
(3n - 12) x + (2n - 12) y = 0.
\]
Since \( x \geq 1 \), we can divide by \( x \) to get:
\[
3n - 12 + \frac{(2n - 12) y}{x} = 0.
\]
But this is not directly helpful. 

Alternatively, let's consider the equation as a linear Diophantine equation in \( x \) and \( y \). The general solution to:
\[
(3n - 12) x + (2n - 12) y = 0
\]
is given by:
\[
x = k (12 - 2n), \quad y = k (12 - 3n),
\]
for some integer \( k \). 

But since \( x, y \geq 1 \), we must have:
\[
k (12 - 2n) \geq 1 \quad \text{and} \quad k (12 - 3n) \geq 1.
\]
This is a system of inequalities in \( k \) and \( n \). 

#### Step 4: Find \( n \) Such That the System Holds
We need to find \( n \geq 1 \) such that there exists a \( k \geq 1 \) satisfying:
\[
k (12 - 2n) \geq 1 \quad \text{and} \quad k (12 - 3n) \geq 1.
\]
This is equivalent to:
\[
12 - 2n \geq \frac{1}{k} \quad \text{and} \quad 12 - 3n \geq \frac{1}{k}.
\]
Since \( k \geq 1 \), the smallest possible \( \frac{1}{k} \) is \( 1 \). Thus, the inequalities simplify to:
\[
12 - 2n \geq 1 \quad \text{and} \quad 12 - 3n \geq 1.
\]
This further simplifies to:
\[
11 \geq 2n \quad \text{and} \quad 11 \geq 3n.
\]
Since \( n \geq 1 \), the largest possible \( n \) satisfying both inequalities is \( n = 3 \). 

But wait, we need to check if \( n = 3 \) is valid. For \( n = 3 \), the general solution is:
\[
x = k (12 - 2 \cdot 3) = 6k, \quad y = k (12 - 3 \cdot 3) = 3k.
\]
Since \( x, y \geq 1 \), we must have \( k \geq 1 \). Thus, \( n = 3 \) is valid. 

But the problem asks to prove that \( n = 5 \). This suggests that there might be a miscalculation or misinterpretation in the original problem. 

However, let's re-examine the original equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}.
\]
Multiply both sides by \( 12n \):
\[
3n x + 2n y = 12 (x + y).
\]
Rearrange:
\[
3n x + 2n y - 12 x - 12 y = 0.
\]
Factor:
\[
(3n - 12) x + (2n - 12) y = 0.
\]
For \( x, y \geq 1 \), the only possible solution is \( n = 3 \). 

But the problem claims \( n = 5 \). This suggests that the original problem might have different coefficients or that there is a miscommunication.
