### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the given equations:
1. \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\),
2. \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\) (in lowest terms),
and we need to find \(m + n = 44\).

However, the Lean 4 statement is slightly different:
1. \(\frac{1}{\cos x} + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\),
2. \(\frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{1}{\tan x} = m\) (where \(m\) is a rational number).

#### Step 1: Simplify the first equation

First, recall that \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). Substitute this into the first equation:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{22}{7}.
\]
Combine the terms on the left:
\[
\frac{1 + \sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{22}{7}.
\]
Multiply both sides by \(\cos x\) (assuming \(\cos x \neq 0\)):
\[
1 + \sin x = \frac{22}{7} \cos x.
\]

#### Step 2: Simplify the second equation

The second equation is:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{1}{\tan x} = m.
\]
Substitute \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\):
\[
\frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = m.
\]
Combine the terms:
\[
\frac{1 + \cos x}{\sin x} = m.
\]

#### Step 3: Eliminate \(\cos x\) and \(\sin x\)

From the first equation:
\[
1 + \sin x = \frac{22}{7} \cos x.
\]
Square both sides:
\[
(1 + \sin x)^2 = \left( \frac{22}{7} \cos x \right)^2.
\]
Expand the left side:
\[
1 + 2 \sin x + \sin^2 x = \frac{484}{49} \cos^2 x.
\]
Use \(\cos^2 x = 1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
1 + 2 \sin x + \sin^2 x = \frac{484}{49} (1 - \sin^2 x).
\]
Multiply both sides by 49:
\[
49 + 98 \sin x + 49 \sin^2 x = 484 - 484 \sin^2 x.
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
49 + 98 \sin x + 49 \sin^2 x + 484 \sin^2 x - 484 = 0.
\]
Simplify:
\[
49 \sin^2 x + 484 \sin^2 x + 98 \sin x + 49 - 484 = 0.
\]
Combine coefficients:
\[
533 \sin^2 x + 98 \sin x - 435 = 0.
\]
This is a quadratic in \(\sin x\). Let \(y = \sin x\):
\[
533 y^2 + 98 y - 435 = 0.
\]
The discriminant is:
\[
D = 98^2 + 4 \cdot 533 \cdot 435 = 9604 + 923820 = 933424.
\]
The roots are:
\[
y = \frac{-98 \pm \sqrt{933424}}{1066} = \frac{-98 \pm 968}{1066}.
\]
Thus:
1. \(y = \frac{-98 + 968}{1066} = \frac{870}{1066} = \frac{435}{533}\),
2. \(y = \frac{-98 - 968}{1066} = \frac{-1066}{1066} = -1\).

Thus, \(\sin x = \frac{435}{533}\) or \(\sin x = -1\).

#### Case 1: \(\sin x = \frac{435}{533}\)

From the first equation:
\[
1 + \sin x = \frac{22}{7} \cos x.
\]
Substitute \(\sin x = \frac{435}{533}\):
\[
1 + \frac{435}{533} = \frac{22}{7} \cos x.
\]
Multiply both sides by 533:
\[
533 + 435 = \frac{22}{7} \cdot 533 \cos x.
\]
Simplify:
\[
968 = \frac{22}{7} \cdot 533 \cos x.
\]
Multiply both sides by \(\frac{7}{22}\):
\[
\frac{968 \cdot 7}{22} = 533 \cos x.
\]
Simplify:
\[
322 = 533 \cos x.
\]
Thus:
\[
\cos x = \frac{322}{533}.
\]

Now, check the second equation:
\[
\frac{1 + \cos x}{\sin x} = m.
\]
Substitute \(\sin x = \frac{435}{533}\) and \(\cos x = \frac{322}{533}\):
\[
\frac{1 + \frac{322}{533}}{\frac{435}{533}} = \frac{\frac{533 + 322}{533}}{\frac{435}{533}} = \frac{\frac{855}{533}}{\frac{435}{533}} = \frac{855}{435} = \frac{171}{87} = \frac{57}{29}.
\]
Thus, \(m = \frac{57}{29}\).

#### Case 2: \(\sin x = -1\)

From the first equation:
\[
1 + \sin x = \frac{22}{7} \cos x.
\]
Substitute \(\sin x = -1\):
\[
1 - 1 = \frac{22}{7} \cos x.
\]
Simplify:
\[
0 = \frac{22}{7} \cos x.
\]
Thus:
\[
\cos x = 0.
\]

Now, check the second equation:
\[
\frac{1 + \cos x}{\sin x} = m.
\]
Substitute \(\sin x = -1\) and \(\cos x = 0\):
\[
\frac{1 + 0}{-1} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1.
\]
Thus, \(m = -1\).

#### Verification of Cases

We have two possible values for \(m\):
1. \(m = \frac{57}{29}\),
2. \(m = -1\).

However, the Lean 4 statement assumes that \(m\) is a rational number, and we need to find \(m + n = 44\).

But in the Lean 4 statement, \(m\) is a rational number, and the second equation is:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{1}{\tan x} = m.
\]
This is equivalent to:
\[
\frac{1 + \cos x}{\sin x} = m.
\]
Thus, \(m\) is a rational number, and we can proceed with the two cases:
1. \(m = \frac{57}{29}\),
2. \(m = -1\).

But in the Lean 4 statement, \(m\) is a rational number, and we need to find \(m + n = 44\).
