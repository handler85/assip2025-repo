### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem correctly. The statement is:

> Let \( a \) and \( b \) be two integer numbers. Show that the following statement is false: \( a \) and \( b \) are both even iff \( 8 \mid a^2 + b^2 \).

This means that the biconditional statement:
\[ (a \text{ and } b \text{ are both even}) \leftrightarrow (8 \mid a^2 + b^2) \]
is **not** true for all integers \( a \) and \( b \).

To disprove the universal statement:
\[ \forall a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, \quad (a \text{ and } b \text{ are both even}) \leftrightarrow (8 \mid a^2 + b^2), \]
we need to find at least one pair of integers \( (a, b) \) for which the biconditional fails. That is, either:
1. \( a \) and \( b \) are both even, but \( 8 \nmid a^2 + b^2 \), or
2. \( a \) and \( b \) are not both even, but \( 8 \mid a^2 + b^2 \).

#### Approach to Find a Counterexample

1. **Assume \( a \) and \( b \) are both even**:
   - Let \( a = 2k \), \( b = 2l \).
   - Then \( a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2 + 4l^2 = 4(k^2 + l^2) \).
   - For \( 8 \mid a^2 + b^2 \), we need \( 8 \mid 4(k^2 + l^2) \), i.e., \( 2 \mid k^2 + l^2 \).
   - This is not guaranteed unless \( k \) and \( l \) are both even or both odd.

2. **Find a specific pair where \( a \) and \( b \) are both even but \( 8 \nmid a^2 + b^2 \)**:
   - Let \( a = 2 \), \( b = 4 \).
   - Then \( a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 16 = 20 \), and \( 8 \nmid 20 \).
   - Also, \( a = 2 = 2 \cdot 1 \) and \( b = 4 = 2 \cdot 2 \), so \( a \) and \( b \) are both even.
   - This is a valid counterexample.

#### Verification

For \( a = 2 \), \( b = 4 \):
1. \( a \) and \( b \) are both even.
2. \( a^2 + b^2 = 20 \), and \( 8 \nmid 20 \).

Thus, the biconditional fails for this pair.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Find a specific pair of integers \( (a, b) \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are both even, but \( 8 \nmid a^2 + b^2 \)**:
   - Choose \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 4 \).

2. **Verify the conditions for this pair**:
   - \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 4 \) are both even.
   - \( a^2 + b^2 = 20 \), and \( 8 \nmid 20 \).

3. **Conclude that the universal statement is false**:
   - The biconditional fails for \( (a, b) = (2, 4) \), so the original statement is false.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements
