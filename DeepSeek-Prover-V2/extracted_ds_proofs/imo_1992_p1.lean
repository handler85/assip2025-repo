### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
We have integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \). The condition is that \((p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)\) divides \( pqr - 1 \). We need to show that the only possible triples \((p, q, r)\) are \((2, 4, 8)\) and \((3, 5, 15)\).

#### Key Observations:
1. The condition \((p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid pqr - 1\) is very restrictive. We can try to find bounds on \(p, q, r\) by analyzing the divisibility.
2. The variables are ordered as \(1 < p < q < r\), so we can use inequalities to bound the possible values.
3. The product \((p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)\) is much smaller than \(pqr\) because \(p, q, r\) are at least 2.

#### Approach:
1. First, we can try to find bounds on \(p, q, r\) by considering the divisibility condition.
2. The condition \((p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid pqr - 1\) can be rewritten as:
   \[
   pqr - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)}
   \]
   This is equivalent to:
   \[
   pqr \equiv 1 \pmod{(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)}
   \]
3. We can use the fact that \(p, q, r \geq 2\) to find bounds on \((p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)\).

#### Bounding \((p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)\):
Since \(p, q, r \geq 2\), we have:
\[
(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \leq (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)
\]
But we can also find a lower bound. Since \(p < q < r\), we have:
\[
(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \geq 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1
\]
But this is not very helpful. Instead, we can use the fact that \(p, q, r \geq 2\) to find a better bound.

#### Better Bounding:
Since \(p, q, r \geq 2\), we have:
\[
(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \leq (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)
\]
But we can also find an upper bound. Since \(p < q < r\), we have:
\[
(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \leq (q - 1)^2 (r - 1)
\]
This is not very helpful either. Instead, we can use the fact that \(p, q, r \geq 2\) and the condition \(pqr - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)}\) to find bounds.

#### Using the Condition:
The condition \(pqr - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)}\) can be rewritten as:
\[
pqr \equiv 1 \pmod{(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)}
\]
This means that \((p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1)\) divides \(pqr - 1\).

#### Finding Possible Values:
We can try to find possible values of \(p, q, r\) that satisfy the condition.

1. **Case \(p = 2\)**:
   - The condition becomes:
     \[
     (2 - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid 2 \cdot q \cdot r - 1
     \]
     i.e.,
     \[
     (q - 1)(r - 1) \mid 2 q r - 1
     \]
   - We can try small values of \(q\):
     - \(q = 3\):
       \[
       (3 - 1)(r - 1) \mid 2 \cdot 3 \cdot r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       2 (r - 1) \mid 6 r - 1
       \]
       This implies \(2 (r - 1) \leq 6 r - 1\) or \(2 r - 2 \leq 6 r - 1\) or \(-4 r \leq 1\) or \(4 r \geq -1\) which is always true. We need to check if \(6 r - 1\) is divisible by \(2 (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       6 r - 1 = 2 (r - 1) \cdot 3 + 5
       \]
       So \(2 (r - 1)\) does not divide \(6 r - 1\) unless \(5 = 0\), which is false. Thus, no solution for \(q = 3\).
     - \(q = 4\):
       \[
       3 (r - 1) \mid 2 \cdot 4 \cdot r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       3 (r - 1) \mid 8 r - 1
       \]
       This implies \(3 (r - 1) \leq 8 r - 1\) or \(3 r - 3 \leq 8 r - 1\) or \(-5 r \leq 2\) or \(5 r \geq -2\) which is always true. We need to check if \(8 r - 1\) is divisible by \(3 (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       8 r - 1 = 3 (r - 1) \cdot 3 + 2
       \]
       So \(3 (r - 1)\) does not divide \(8 r - 1\) unless \(2 = 0\), which is false. Thus, no solution for \(q = 4\).
     - \(q = 5\):
       \[
       4 (r - 1) \mid 2 \cdot 5 \cdot r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       4 (r - 1) \mid 10 r - 1
       \]
       This implies \(4 (r - 1) \leq 10 r - 1\) or \(4 r - 4 \leq 10 r - 1\) or \(-6 r \leq 3\) or \(6 r \geq -3\) which is always true. We need to check if \(10 r - 1\) is divisible by \(4 (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       10 r - 1 = 4 (r - 1) \cdot 3 + 1
       \]
       So \(4 (r - 1)\) does not divide \(10 r - 1\) unless \(1 = 0\), which is false. Thus, no solution for \(q = 5\).
   - It seems that for \(p = 2\), there are no solutions.

2. **Case \(p = 3\)**:
   - The condition becomes:
     \[
     (3 - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid 3 \cdot q \cdot r - 1
     \]
     i.e.,
     \[
     2 (q - 1)(r - 1) \mid 3 q r - 1
     \]
   - We can try small values of \(q\):
     - \(q = 4\):
       \[
       2 \cdot 3 \cdot (r - 1) \mid 3 \cdot 4 \cdot r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       6 (r - 1) \mid 12 r - 1
       \]
       This implies \(6 (r - 1) \leq 12 r - 1\) or \(6 r - 6 \leq 12 r - 1\) or \(-6 r \leq 5\) or \(6 r \geq -5\) which is always true. We need to check if \(12 r - 1\) is divisible by \(6 (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       12 r - 1 = 6 (r - 1) \cdot 2 + 5
       \]
       So \(6 (r - 1)\) does not divide \(12 r - 1\) unless \(5 = 0\), which is false. Thus, no solution for \(q = 4\).
     - \(q = 5\):
       \[
       2 \cdot 4 \cdot (r - 1) \mid 3 \cdot 5 \cdot r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       8 (r - 1) \mid 15 r - 1
       \]
       This implies \(8 (r - 1) \leq 15 r - 1\) or \(8 r - 8 \leq 15 r - 1\) or \(-7 r \leq 7\) or \(7 r \geq -7\) which is always true. We need to check if \(15 r - 1\) is divisible by \(8 (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       15 r - 1 = 8 (r - 1) \cdot 2 + 7
       \]
       So \(8 (r - 1)\) does not divide \(15 r - 1\) unless \(7 = 0\), which is false. Thus, no solution for \(q = 5\).
   - It seems that for \(p = 3\), there are no solutions.

3. **Case \(p = 4\)**:
   - The condition becomes:
     \[
     (4 - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid 4 \cdot q \cdot r - 1
     \]
     i.e.,
     \[
     3 (q - 1)(r - 1) \mid 4 q r - 1
     \]
   - We can try small values of \(q\):
     - \(q = 5\):
       \[
       3 \cdot 4 \cdot (r - 1) \mid 4 \cdot 5 \cdot r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       12 (r - 1) \mid 20 r - 1
       \]
       This implies \(12 (r - 1) \leq 20 r - 1\) or \(12 r - 12 \leq 20 r - 1\) or \(-8 r \leq 11\) or \(8 r \geq -11\) which is always true. We need to check if \(20 r - 1\) is divisible by \(12 (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       20 r - 1 = 12 (r - 1) \cdot 2 + 5
       \]
       So \(12 (r - 1)\) does not divide \(20 r - 1\) unless \(5 = 0\), which is false. Thus, no solution for \(q = 5\).
     - \(q = 6\):
       \[
       3 \cdot 5 \cdot (r - 1) \mid 4 \cdot 6 \cdot r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       15 (r - 1) \mid 24 r - 1
       \]
       This implies \(15 (r - 1) \leq 24 r - 1\) or \(15 r - 15 \leq 24 r - 1\) or \(-9 r \leq 14\) or \(9 r \geq -14\) which is always true. We need to check if \(24 r - 1\) is divisible by \(15 (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       24 r - 1 = 15 (r - 1) \cdot 2 + 9
       \]
       So \(15 (r - 1)\) does not divide \(24 r - 1\) unless \(9 = 0\), which is false. Thus, no solution for \(q = 6\).
   - It seems that for \(p = 4\), there are no solutions.

4. **Case \(p = 5\)**:
   - The condition becomes:
     \[
     (5 - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid 5 \cdot q \cdot r - 1
     \]
     i.e.,
     \[
     4 (q - 1)(r - 1) \mid 5 q r - 1
     \]
   - We can try small values of \(q\):
     - \(q = 6\):
       \[
       4 \cdot 5 \cdot (r - 1) \mid 5 \cdot 6 \cdot r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       20 (r - 1) \mid 30 r - 1
       \]
       This implies \(20 (r - 1) \leq 30 r - 1\) or \(20 r - 20 \leq 30 r - 1\) or \(-10 r \leq 19\) or \(10 r \geq -19\) which is always true. We need to check if \(30 r - 1\) is divisible by \(20 (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       30 r - 1 = 20 (r - 1) \cdot 2 + 10
       \]
       So \(20 (r - 1)\) does not divide \(30 r - 1\) unless \(10 = 0\), which is false. Thus, no solution for \(q = 6\).
     - \(q = 7\):
       \[
       4 \cdot 6 \cdot (r - 1) \mid 5 \cdot 7 \cdot r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       24 (r - 1) \mid 35 r - 1
       \]
       This implies \(24 (r - 1) \leq 35 r - 1\) or \(24 r - 24 \leq 35 r - 1\) or \(-11 r \leq 23\) or \(11 r \geq -23\) which is always true. We need to check if \(35 r - 1\) is divisible by \(24 (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       35 r - 1 = 24 (r - 1) \cdot 2 + 11
       \]
       So \(24 (r - 1)\) does not divide \(35 r - 1\) unless \(11 = 0\), which is false. Thus, no solution for \(q = 7\).
   - It seems that for \(p = 5\), there are no solutions.

5. **Case \(p \geq 6\)**:
   - The condition becomes:
     \[
     (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid p q r - 1
     \]
   - We can try small values of \(q\):
     - \(q = p\):
       \[
       (p - 1)(p - 1)(r - 1) \mid p^2 r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       (p - 1)^2 (r - 1) \mid p^2 r - 1
       \]
       This implies \((p - 1)^2 (r - 1) \leq p^2 r - 1\) or \((p - 1)^2 (r - 1) \leq p^2 r - 1\) which is always true. We need to check if \(p^2 r - 1\) is divisible by \((p - 1)^2 (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       p^2 r - 1 = (p - 1)^2 (r - 1) \cdot \frac{p^2 r - 1}{(p - 1)^2 (r - 1)}
       \]
       So \((p - 1)^2 (r - 1)\) divides \(p^2 r - 1\) if and only if \(\frac{p^2 r - 1}{(p - 1)^2 (r - 1)}\) is an integer. This is not guaranteed for all \(p, r \geq 2\). For example, take \(p = 6, r = 2\):
       \[
       \frac{6^2 \cdot 2 - 1}{(6 - 1)^2 (2 - 1)} = \frac{71}{25}
       \]
       which is not an integer. Thus, no solution for \(q = p\).
     - \(q = p + 1\):
       \[
       (p - 1)(p)(r - 1) \mid p (p + 1) r - 1
       \]
       i.e.,
       \[
       p (p - 1) (r - 1) \mid p (p + 1) r - 1
       \]
       This implies \(p (p - 1) (r - 1) \leq p (p + 1) r - 1\) or \(p (p - 1) (r - 1) \leq p (p + 1) r - 1\) which is always true. We need to check if \(p (p + 1) r - 1\) is divisible by \(p (p - 1) (r - 1)\). We can write:
       \[
       p (p + 1) r - 1 = p (p - 1) (r - 1) \cdot \frac{p (p + 1) r - 1}{p (p - 1) (r - 1)}
       \]
       So \(p (p - 1) (r - 1)\) divides \(p (p + 1) r - 1\) if and only if \(\frac{p (p + 1) r - 1}{p (p - 1) (r - 1)}\) is an integer. This is not guaranteed for all \(p, r \geq 2\). For example, take \(p = 6, r = 2\):
       \[
       \frac{6 (6 + 1) \cdot 2 - 1}{6 (6 - 1) (2 - 1)} = \frac{71}{30}
       \]
       which is not an integer. Thus, no solution for \(q = p + 1\).
   - It seems that for \(p \geq 6\), there are no solutions.

### Summary of Cases:

2. For \(p = 3\), no solutions.
3. For \(p = 4\), no solutions.
4. For \(p = 5\), no solutions.
5. For \(p \geq 6\), no solutions.
