### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem Analysis:**
We need to prove that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. 

**Key Observations:**
1. If \( n \) is not prime, then \( n \) is either \( 1 \) or a composite number.
2. If \( n = 1 \), then \( 2^1 - 1 = 1 \), which is not prime.
3. If \( n \) is composite and \( n > 1 \), then \( 2^n - 1 \) can be factored. For example, if \( n = pq \), then \( 2^n - 1 = (2^p - 1)(2^{p(q-1)} + 2^{p(q-2)} + \dots + 2^p + 1) \), which is a nontrivial factorization unless \( 2^p - 1 = 1 \), i.e., \( p = 1 \). But \( p \geq 2 \) is a prime factor of \( n \), and \( 2^p - 1 \geq 3 \), so \( 2^n - 1 \) is composite.

**Proof Sketch:**
1. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n = 1 \) or \( n \) is composite.
2. If \( n = 1 \), then \( 2^1 - 1 = 1 \), which is not prime. Contradiction.
3. If \( n \) is composite, then \( n = pq \) for some primes \( p, q \geq 2 \). Then \( 2^n - 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^p - 1 \geq 3 \), so \( 2^n - 1 \) is composite. Contradiction.
4. Therefore, \( n \) must be prime.

**Detailed Proof:**
1. Assume for contradiction that \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n \) is either \( 1 \) or a composite number.
   - If \( n = 1 \), then \( 2^1 - 1 = 1 \), which is not a prime number. This contradicts the assumption that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime.
   - If \( n \) is composite, then there exist integers \( a, b > 1 \) such that \( n = a \cdot b \).

2. We can factor \( 2^n - 1 \) as follows:
   \[
   2^n - 1 = 2^{a \cdot b} - 1 = (2^a)^b - 1 = (2^a - 1)((2^a)^{b-1} + (2^a)^{b-2} + \dots + 2^a + 1).
   \]
   This is a nontrivial factorization of \( 2^n - 1 \) because \( 2^a - 1 \geq 3 \) (since \( a \geq 2 \)) and the second factor is at least \( 1 + 1 = 2 \). Therefore, \( 2^n - 1 \) is composite, contradicting the assumption that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime.

3. The only remaining possibility is that \( n \) is prime. Hence, the proof is complete.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Assume \( n \) is not prime**:
   - \( n = 1 \) or \( n \) is composite.

2. **Case \( n = 1 \)**:
   - \( 2^1 - 1 = 1 \), which is not prime. Contradiction.

3. **Case \( n \) is composite**:
   - Factor \( n = a \cdot b \) with \( a, b > 1 \).
   - Factor \( 2^n - 1 \) as \( (2^a - 1) \cdot \text{something} \).
   - Since \( 2^a - 1 \geq 3 \), \( 2^n - 1 \) is composite. Contradiction.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - \( n \) must be prime.
