### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given two positive integers `m` and `n` (i.e., `m, n ≥ 2` because `1 < m` and `1 < n`) such that `m * n = 2005`. We need to prove that `m + n = 406`.

#### Step 1: Factorize 2005
First, factorize 2005 to find its prime factors:
\[ 2005 = 5 \times 401 \]
Since 401 is a prime number (as verified by checking divisibility by primes up to its square root, i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41), the only positive integer factor pairs of 2005 are:
\[ (1, 2005), (5, 401) \]

But since `m` and `n` are both `> 1`, the only possible pair is `(5, 401)`.

#### Step 2: Verify the Solution
Given `m = 5` and `n = 401`, we have:
\[ m + n = 5 + 401 = 406 \]
This is the unique solution under the given constraints.

#### Step 3: Uniqueness of the Solution
The factorization of 2005 is unique (up to order), and since `m` and `n` are both `> 1`, the only possible pair is `(5, 401)`.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Factorize 2005**:
   - Find all positive integer factor pairs of 2005.
   - The only factor pairs are `(1, 2005)` and `(5, 401)`.

2. **Apply Constraints**:
   - Since `m > 1` and `n > 1`, the only possible pair is `(5, 401)`.

3. **Calculate Sum**:
   - `m + n = 5 + 401 = 406`.

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_541
  (m n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : 1 < m)
  (h₁ : 1 < n)
  (h₂ : m * n = 2005) :
  m + n = 406 := by
  have h_main : m = 5 ∧ n = 401 ∨ m = 401 ∧ n = 5 := by
    sorry
  have h_final : m + n = 406 := by
    sorry
  exact h_final
```

### Explanation:
1. `h_main`: This statement captures that the only possible pairs `(m, n)` are `(5, 401)` and `(401, 5)`, derived from the factorization of 2005.
2. `h_final`: This statement uses `h_main` to conclude that `m + n = 406` in both cases.
