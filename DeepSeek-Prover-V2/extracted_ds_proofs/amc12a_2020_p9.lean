### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find all real numbers \( x \) in the interval \([0, 2\pi]\) such that \(\tan(2x) = \cos(x/2)\). 

#### Step 1: Understand the Domain and Constraints
1. The equation \(\tan(2x) = \cos(x/2)\) is undefined when \(\cos(2x) = 0\) (i.e., \(2x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\) or \(x = \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{k\pi}{2}\) for integer \(k\)). However, the problem is well-posed because the Lean statement assumes that \(x \in S\) is equivalent to \(0 \leq x \leq 2\pi\) and \(\tan(2x) = \cos(x/2)\), and does not explicitly exclude the undefined points.
   - But Lean's `Real.tan` is defined as `sin x / cos x`, and `Real.cos x = 0` makes `Real.tan x` undefined. However, Lean's `Real.tan` is total and returns `0` when `cos x = 0` (this is a design choice). So, in Lean, `Real.tan x = 0` when `cos x = 0` (i.e., `x = π/2 + kπ`).
   - But the problem is that Lean's `Real.tan` is not the same as the mathematical `tan` function. The mathematical `tan` is undefined at `π/2 + kπ`, but Lean's `Real.tan` is defined as `sin x / cos x` and returns `0` when `cos x = 0`.
   - However, the Lean statement is `h₀ : ∀ (x : ℝ), x ∈ S ↔ 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 2 * Real.pi ∧ Real.tan (2 * x) = Real.cos (x / 2)`, and `Real.tan (2 * x)` is well-defined in Lean for all `x` (even when `cos (2 * x) = 0`).
   - So, we can proceed with the proof as if `tan` is well-defined everywhere, and later check that the solutions we find are valid.

2. The interval is \([0, 2\pi]\).

#### Step 2: Find Solutions
We need to find all \(x \in [0, 2\pi]\) such that \(\tan(2x) = \cos(x/2)\).

First, recall that \(\tan(2x) = \frac{\sin(2x)}{\cos(2x)}\) and \(\cos(x/2) = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos x}{2}}\) (but we won't need this).

Alternatively, we can use the double-angle identity for cosine:
\[ \cos(x/2) = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos x}{2}} \]
but this seems complicated.

Instead, we can try to find specific values of \(x\) that satisfy the equation.

1. **Try \(x = 0\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot 0) = \tan(0) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(0/2) = \cos(0) = 1\)
   - \(0 \neq 1\), so \(x = 0\) is not a solution.

2. **Try \(x = \pi/2\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot \pi/2) = \tan(\pi) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(\pi/2 / 2) = \cos(\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2 \approx 0.707 \neq 0\)
   - \(0 \neq \sqrt{2}/2\), so \(x = \pi/2\) is not a solution.

3. **Try \(x = \pi\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot \pi) = \tan(2\pi) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(\pi/2) = 0\)
   - \(0 = 0\), so \(x = \pi\) is a solution.

4. **Try \(x = 3\pi/2\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot 3\pi/2) = \tan(3\pi) = \tan(\pi + 2\pi) = \tan(\pi) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(3\pi/2 / 2) = \cos(3\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2 \approx -0.707 \neq 0\)
   - \(0 \neq -\sqrt{2}/2\), so \(x = 3\pi/2\) is not a solution.

5. **Try \(x = 2\pi\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot 2\pi) = \tan(4\pi) = \tan(0) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(2\pi/2) = \cos(\pi) = 0\)
   - \(0 = 0\), so \(x = 2\pi\) is a solution.

6. **Try \(x = 5\pi/2\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot 5\pi/2) = \tan(5\pi) = \tan(\pi + 4\pi) = \tan(\pi) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(5\pi/2 / 2) = \cos(5\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2 \neq 0\)
   - \(0 \neq -\sqrt{2}/2\), so \(x = 5\pi/2\) is not a solution.

7. **Try \(x = 7\pi/2\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot 7\pi/2) = \tan(7\pi) = \tan(\pi + 6\pi) = \tan(\pi) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(7\pi/2 / 2) = \cos(7\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2 \neq 0\)
   - \(0 \neq \sqrt{2}/2\), so \(x = 7\pi/2\) is not a solution.

8. **Try \(x = 9\pi/2\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot 9\pi/2) = \tan(9\pi) = \tan(9\pi - 4\pi) = \tan(5\pi) = \tan(\pi + 4\pi) = \tan(\pi) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(9\pi/2 / 2) = \cos(9\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2 \neq 0\)
   - \(0 \neq -\sqrt{2}/2\), so \(x = 9\pi/2\) is not a solution.

9. **Try \(x = 11\pi/2\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot 11\pi/2) = \tan(11\pi) = \tan(11\pi - 6\pi) = \tan(5\pi) = \tan(\pi + 4\pi) = \tan(\pi) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(11\pi/2 / 2) = \cos(11\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2 \neq 0\)
   - \(0 \neq \sqrt{2}/2\), so \(x = 11\pi/2\) is not a solution.

#### Step 3: General Solution
From the above, the solutions in \([0, 2\pi]\) are \(x = \pi\) and \(x = 2\pi\).

But wait, we missed checking \(x = 0\) and \(x = 3\pi/2\) earlier. Let's re-evaluate:

1. **Check \(x = 0\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot 0) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(0/2) = 1\)
   - \(0 \neq 1\), so \(x = 0\) is not a solution.

2. **Check \(x = 3\pi/2\)**:
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot 3\pi/2) = \tan(3\pi) = \tan(\pi + 2\pi) = \tan(\pi) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(3\pi/2 / 2) = \cos(3\pi/4) = -\sqrt{2}/2 \neq 0\)
   - \(0 \neq -\sqrt{2}/2\), so \(x = 3\pi/2\) is not a solution.

Thus, the only solutions in \([0, 2\pi]\) are \(x = \pi\) and \(x = 2\pi\).

But wait, we have \(S\) as a set of real numbers, and we need to find its cardinality. The cardinality of \(S\) is 2, because \(S = \{\pi, 2\pi\}\).

#### Step 4: Verification
We need to ensure that the solutions are correct. Let's verify \(x = \pi\) and \(x = 2\pi\):

1. For \(x = \pi\):
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot \pi) = \tan(2\pi) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(\pi/2) = 0\)
   - \(0 = 0\), so \(x = \pi\) is a solution.

2. For \(x = 2\pi\):
   - \(\tan(2 \cdot 2\pi) = \tan(4\pi) = \tan(0) = 0\)
   - \(\cos(2\pi/2) = \cos(\pi) = 0\)
   - \(0 = 0\), so \(x = 2\pi\) is a solution.

Thus, the solutions are correct, and the cardinality of \(S\) is 2.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We need to find all real numbers \(x\) in \([0, 2\pi]\) such that \(\tan(2x) = \cos(x/2)\).
   - The set \(S\) is the set of all such \(x\).

2. **Find Solutions**:
   - We can try specific values of \(x\) in \([0, 2\pi]\) to find solutions.
   - We can also use the periodicity of the functions involved to find all solutions.

3. **Verify Solutions**:
   - For each candidate solution, verify that it satisfies the original equation.
   - Ensure that no additional solutions are missed.

4. **Determine Cardinality**:
   - Count the number of distinct solutions found.
   - The cardinality of \(S\) is the number of distinct solutions.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The solutions are \(x = \pi\) and \(x = 2\pi\).
   - The cardinality of \(S\) is 2.
