### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have a system of two linear equations in three variables \(x, y, z\):
1. \(3x + 4y - 12z = 10\) (Equation A)
2. \(-2x - 3y + 9z = -4\) (Equation B)

We need to find the value of \(x\) and show that it is \(14\).

**Approach:**
To solve for \(x\), we can eliminate one of the variables \(y\) or \(z\) by combining the two equations. Here, we will eliminate \(y\) by multiplying Equation A by \(3\) and Equation B by \(4\), and then subtracting the resulting equations to eliminate \(y\).

**Step 1: Multiply Equation A by \(3\) and Equation B by \(4\):**
1. \(3 \cdot (3x + 4y - 12z) = 3 \cdot 10\) → \(9x + 12y - 36z = 30\) (Equation A')
2. \(4 \cdot (-2x - 3y + 9z) = 4 \cdot (-4)\) → \(-8x - 12y + 36z = -16\) (Equation B')

**Step 2: Subtract Equation B' from Equation A':**
1. \((9x + 12y - 36z) - (-8x - 12y + 36z) = 30 - (-16)\)
2. \(9x + 12y - 36z + 8x + 12y - 36z = 30 + 16\)
3. \((9x + 8x) + (12y + 12y) + (-36z - 36z) = 46\)
4. \(17x + 24y - 72z = 46\) (Equation C)

**Step 3: Solve the Original System for \(x\):**
We now have the system:
1. \(3x + 4y - 12z = 10\) (Equation A)
2. \(17x + 24y - 72z = 46\) (Equation C)

To eliminate \(y\), multiply Equation A by \(6\):
1. \(6 \cdot (3x + 4y - 12z) = 6 \cdot 10\) → \(18x + 24y - 72z = 60\) (Equation D)

Subtract Equation C from Equation D:
1. \((18x + 24y - 72z) - (17x + 24y - 72z) = 60 - 46\)
2. \(18x + 24y - 72z - 17x - 24y + 72z = 14\)
3. \((18x - 17x) + (24y - 24y) + (-72z + 72z) = 14\)
4. \(x = 14\)

Thus, we have found that \(x = 14\).

### Step 4: Verification

We can verify the solution by substituting \(x = 14\) back into the original equations.

1. **First Equation:**
   \[
   3(14) + 4y - 12z = 10 \implies 42 + 4y - 12z = 10 \implies 4y - 12z = -32
   \]
   \[
   4y - 12z = -32 \quad \text{(Equation E)}
   \]

2. **Second Equation:**
   \[
   -2(14) - 3y + 9z = -4 \implies -28 - 3y + 9z = -4 \implies -3y + 9z = 24
   \]
   \[
   -3y + 9z = 24 \quad \text{(Equation F)}
   \]

Now, we can solve Equation E and Equation F for \(y\) and \(z\).

Multiply Equation E by \(3\):
\[
3(4y - 12z) = 3(-32) \implies 12y - 36z = -96
\]

Multiply Equation F by \(4\):
\[
4(-3y + 9z) = 4(24) \implies -12y + 36z = 96
\]

Add the two new equations:
\[
(12y - 36z) + (-12y + 36z) = -96 + 96 \implies 0 = 0
\]

This is an identity, so we can choose any value for \(y\) and \(z\) that satisfies the original equations. For simplicity, we can set \(y = 0\) and solve for \(z\):

From Equation E:
\[
4(0) - 12z = -32 \implies -12z = -32 \implies z = \frac{32}{12} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

Thus, a solution is \(x = 14\), \(y = 0\), \(z = \frac{8}{3}\).

### Step 5: Abstract Plan

1. **Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 4 to eliminate \(y\).**
   - This gives two new equations:
     - \(9x + 12y - 36z = 30\)
     - \(-8x - 12y + 36z = -16\)

2. **Add the two new equations to eliminate \(y\) and solve for \(x\).**
   - The sum is \(x = 14\).

3. **Verify the solution by substituting back into the original equations.**
   - The solution \(x = 14\) satisfies both original equations.
