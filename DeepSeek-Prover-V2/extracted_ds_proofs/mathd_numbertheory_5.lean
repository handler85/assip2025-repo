### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
1. We have a natural number `n ≥ 10`.
2. There exists a natural number `x` such that `x² = n`.
3. There exists a natural number `t` such that `t³ = n`.
4. We need to prove that `n ≥ 64`.

#### Key Observations:
1. The smallest perfect square `≥ 10` is `16` (`4²`), but `16` is not a perfect cube (`2³ = 8`, `3³ = 27`). The next perfect square is `25` (`5²`), and `25` is not a perfect cube. The next is `36` (`6²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `49` (`7²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `64` (`8²`), and `64 = 4³`.
2. The next perfect square after `64` is `81` (`9²`), but `81` is not a perfect cube (`4³ = 64`, `5³ = 125`). The next is `100` (`10²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `121` (`11²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `144` (`12²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `169` (`13²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `196` (`14²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `225` (`15²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `256` (`16²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `289` (`17²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `324` (`18²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `361` (`19²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `400` (`20²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `441` (`21²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `484` (`22²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `529` (`23²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `576` (`24²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `625` (`25²`), and `625 = 5³`.
3. The smallest `n` that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is `1` (`1² = 1³`), but `n ≥ 10` is given. The next is `64` (`8² = 4³`).

#### Proof Sketch:
1. Let `n` be a natural number such that `10 ≤ n`, `n` is a perfect square, and `n` is a perfect cube.
2. The smallest perfect square `≥ 10` is `16` (`4²`), but `16` is not a perfect cube. The next is `25` (`5²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `36` (`6²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `49` (`7²`), not a perfect cube. The next is `64` (`8²`), and `64 = 4³`.
3. Therefore, `n ≥ 64`.

#### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan:
1. Assume `n` is a natural number with `10 ≤ n`, `n` is a perfect square, and `n` is a perfect cube.
2. The smallest perfect square `≥ 10` is `16`, but `16` is not a perfect cube.
3. The next perfect square is `25`, not a perfect cube.
4. The next is `36`, not a perfect cube.
5. The next is `49`, not a perfect cube.
6. The next is `64`, which is `8²` and `4³`.
7. Therefore, `n ≥ 64`.
