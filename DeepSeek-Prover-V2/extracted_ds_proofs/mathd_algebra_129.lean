### Detailed Proof

**Problem:** Solve for \( a \): \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\). Show that \( a = -2 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Simplify the Fractional Expressions:**
   - \( 8^{-1} = \frac{1}{8} \)
   - \( 4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4} \)
   - So, \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \dfrac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \dfrac{1}{8} \cdot 4 = \dfrac{4}{8} = \dfrac{1}{2}\).

2. **Substitute Back into the Equation:**
   - The original equation becomes:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1.
     \]
   - Subtract \(\frac{1}{2}\) from both sides:
     \[
     -a^{-1} = \frac{1}{2}.
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
     \[
     a^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2}.
     \]
   - Take reciprocals of both sides:
     \[
     a = -2.
     \]

3. **Verification:**
   - Substitute \( a = -2 \) back into the original equation:
     \[
     \frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} - \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.
     \]
   - The solution is correct.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the Fractional Expressions:**
   - Compute \( 8^{-1} = \frac{1}{8} \) and \( 4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4} \).
   - Divide them to get \( \frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Substitute and Solve for \( a \):**
   - Substitute \( \frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \frac{1}{2} \) into the original equation.
   - Simplify to get \( \frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1 \).
   - Rearrange to \( a^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2} \).
   - Take reciprocals to get \( a = -2 \).

3. **Verification:**
   - Plug \( a = -2 \) back into the original equation to ensure it holds.
