### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50. However, the problem statement is slightly different: it asks for the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 49 (inclusive). 

But wait, the Lean code is filtering `Finset.Icc 1 49` and checking if `3 ∣ x` (i.e., `x` is a multiple of 3). The sum is then taken of the units digits of these numbers. 

But the units digit of a number `x` is `x % 10`. So the sum is `∑ (x % 10) for x in {1, ..., 49} and 3 ∣ x`.

#### Step 1: Find all multiples of 3 between 1 and 49

First, find the smallest and largest multiples of 3 in this range:
- The smallest is `3` (since `1` is not a multiple of `3`).
- The largest is `48` (since `51 > 49`).

So the multiples of `3` in `{1, ..., 49}` are `3, 6, ..., 48`.

#### Step 2: Find the number of terms

The sequence is `3, 6, ..., 48`. This is an arithmetic sequence with:
- First term `a_1 = 3`,
- Last term `a_n = 48`,
- Common difference `d = 3`.

The number of terms `n` is given by:
`a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d`
`48 = 3 + (n - 1) * 3`
`48 = 3 + 3n - 3`
`48 = 3n`
`n = 16`.

So there are `16` terms.

#### Step 3: Find the sum of the units digits

The units digit of a number `x` is `x % 10`. The sum we want is:
`S = ∑_{k=1}^{16} (3k % 10)`.

First, compute `3k % 10` for `k = 1` to `16`:
- `3 * 1 = 3 → 3 % 10 = 3`
- `3 * 2 = 6 → 6 % 10 = 6`
- `3 * 3 = 9 → 9 % 10 = 9`
- `3 * 4 = 12 → 12 % 10 = 2`
- `3 * 5 = 15 → 15 % 10 = 5`
- `3 * 6 = 18 → 18 % 10 = 8`
- `3 * 7 = 21 → 21 % 10 = 1`
- `3 * 8 = 24 → 24 % 10 = 4`
- `3 * 9 = 27 → 27 % 10 = 7`
- `3 * 10 = 30 → 30 % 10 = 0`
- `3 * 11 = 33 → 33 % 10 = 3`
- `3 * 12 = 36 → 36 % 10 = 6`
- `3 * 13 = 39 → 39 % 10 = 9`
- `3 * 14 = 42 → 42 % 10 = 2`
- `3 * 15 = 45 → 45 % 10 = 5`
- `3 * 16 = 48 → 48 % 10 = 8`

So the sum is:
`S = 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78`.

#### Step 4: Verification

Alternatively, we can observe that the sum of the units digits of multiples of `3` from `0` to `48` is the same as the sum of the units digits of multiples of `3` from `0` to `99` (since the pattern repeats every `10` numbers). 

The sum of the units digits of multiples of `3` from `0` to `99` is:
`3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + ...`

This is an infinite series where the sum of every `10` terms is `45` (since `3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 = 45`). 

Since `99 / 10 = 9.9`, the sum of the first `90` terms is `9 * 45 = 405`. 

The sum of the first `90` terms is `405`, and the sum of the next `9` terms is `45` (since `99 - 90 = 9`). 

Thus, the total sum is `405 + 45 = 450`. 

But wait, this contradicts our earlier calculation. 

The mistake is that the sum of the first `90` terms is not `9 * 45 = 405`, but rather `9 * 45 = 405` is correct. 

But the sum of the first `90` terms is `405`, and the sum of the next `9` terms is `45`, so the total sum is `405 + 45 = 450`. 

This matches our earlier calculation. 

Thus, the sum of the units digits of all multiples of `3` from `0` to `48` is `450`. 

But this is incorrect. 

The correct sum is `78`, as derived earlier. 

The mistake was in the initial calculation of the sum of the first `90` terms. 

The correct sum is `405 + 45 = 450`, but this is incorrect. 

The correct sum is `78`, as derived earlier. 

Thus, the correct sum is `78`. 

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Identify the range of numbers**: We need to find all multiples of `3` between `1` and `49` (inclusive).
2. **Find the number of terms**: The smallest multiple of `3` in the range is `3`, and the largest is `48`. The number of terms is `(48 - 3) / 3 + 1 = 16`.
3. **List the terms**: The terms are `3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48`.
4. **Find the units digit of each term**: The units digits are `3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8`.
5. **Sum the units digits**: The sum is `3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78`.
