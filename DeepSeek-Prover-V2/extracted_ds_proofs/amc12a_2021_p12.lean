### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We have a polynomial function `f : ℂ → ℂ` defined by:
\[ f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + a z^4 + b z^3 + c z^2 + d z + 16 \]
and the hypothesis that for every `z` such that `f(z) = 0`, the following holds:
1. The imaginary part of `z` is `0` (i.e., `z` is real).
2. The real part of `z` is positive (`0 < Re(z)`).
3. The floor of the real part of `z` is equal to the real part of `z` itself (`⌊Re(z)⌋ = Re(z)`).

This means that every root `z` of `f(z) = 0` is a positive real number whose real part is an integer (since `⌊Re(z)⌋ = Re(z)`).

However, the problem is **not** asking us to find the roots of `f(z) = 0` or to determine the coefficients `a, b, c, d`. Instead, it is asking us to find the value of `b` under the given conditions. 

But wait, the hypothesis `h₁` is too strong because it claims that for every `z` with `f(z) = 0`, `z` is a positive real number with `⌊Re(z)⌋ = Re(z)`, i.e., `Re(z)` is an integer. 

But the polynomial `f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + a z^4 + b z^3 + c z^2 + d z + 16` is **not** arbitrary. The coefficients `a, b, c, d` are fixed, and the roots of `f(z) = 0` are given to be positive real numbers with `⌊Re(z)⌋ = Re(z)`. 

But the roots of `f(z) = 0` are not arbitrary. For example, if `z = 1` is a root, then `1 - 10 + a + b + c + d + 16 = 0` or `a + b + c + d = -15`. 

But we need to find `b`. 

But the hypothesis `h₁` is too strong because it claims that for every `z` with `f(z) = 0`, `z` is a positive real number with `⌊Re(z)⌋ = Re(z)`, i.e., `Re(z)` is an integer. 

But the roots of `f(z) = 0` are not necessarily integers. For example, if `a = b = c = d = 0`, then `f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + 16 = 0` has roots that are not integers.
