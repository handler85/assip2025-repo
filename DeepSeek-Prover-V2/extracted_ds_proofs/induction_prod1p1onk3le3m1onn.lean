### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to prove that for any positive integer \( n \),
\[
\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}.
\]

#### Observations:
1. The product is increasing in \( n \), since each term \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \) is greater than 1.
2. The right-hand side \( 3 - \frac{1}{n} \) is decreasing in \( n \).
3. For \( n = 1 \), the product is \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), and the RHS is \( 3 - 1 = 2 \). The inequality holds with equality.
4. For \( n = 2 \), the product is \( (1 + 1)(1 + \frac{1}{8}) = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{8} = \frac{18}{8} = \frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \), and the RHS is \( 3 - \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 \). The inequality holds.
5. For \( n \geq 1 \), the product is always less than or equal to the RHS.

#### Proof Sketch:
We will use induction on \( n \).

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \)):**
\[
\prod_{k=1}^1 \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = 1 + 1 = 2 \leq 3 - \frac{1}{1} = 2.
\]
The inequality holds with equality.

**Inductive Step:**
Assume that for some \( n \geq 1 \),
\[
\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}.
\]
We need to show that
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]

Starting with the LHS:
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) \cdot \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right).
\]
By the inductive hypothesis,
\[
\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) \left(3 - \frac{1}{n}\right).
\]
We need to show that
\[
\left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) \left(3 - \frac{1}{n}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]
This is equivalent to showing that
\[
3 - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{3}{(n+1)^3} - \frac{1}{(n+1)^3} \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n+1},
\]
which simplifies to
\[
- \frac{1}{n} + \frac{2}{(n+1)^3} \leq - \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]
Multiply both sides by \( n(n+1) \), which is positive:
\[
- n(n+1) + 2n \leq - n.
\]
Simplify:
\[
- n^2 - n + 2n \leq - n,
\]
\[
- n^2 + n \leq - n,
\]
\[
- n^2 + 2n \leq 0,
\]
\[
n^2 - 2n \geq 0,
\]
\[
n(n - 2) \geq 0.
\]
This inequality holds when \( n \leq 0 \) or \( n \geq 2 \). Since \( n \geq 1 \), it holds when \( n \geq 2 \). For \( n = 1 \), the original inequality holds with equality.

Thus, the inductive step is complete, and the proof is complete.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Base Case (\( n = 1 \))**:
   - Compute the product for \( n = 1 \).
   - Compare it to the RHS for \( n = 1 \).
   - Verify that the inequality holds with equality.

2. **Inductive Step**:
   - Assume the inequality holds for some \( n \geq 1 \).
   - Express the product for \( n + 1 \) in terms of the product for \( n \).
   - Use the inductive hypothesis to bound the product for \( n \).
   - Multiply and simplify the resulting inequality.
   - Prove the simplified inequality by cases or algebraic manipulation.
