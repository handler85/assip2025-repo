### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's carefully restate the problem and understand the hypotheses and the goal.

**Problem Statement:**
We are given:
1. Real numbers `m`, `n`, and `k` (`k` is a positive natural number).
2. A sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` of real constants.
3. A function `y : ℝ → ℝ` defined by `y(x) = ∑_{i=0}^{k-1} (cos(a_i + x) / 2^i)`.
4. The conditions `y(m) = 0` and `y(n) = 0`.

We need to prove that there exists an integer `t` such that `m - n = t * π`.

**Observations:**
1. The function `y(x)` is a finite sum of terms of the form `cos(a_i + x) / 2^i`.
2. The condition `y(m) = 0` is equivalent to `∑_{i=0}^{k-1} (cos(a_i + m) / 2^i) = 0`.
3. Similarly, `y(n) = 0` is equivalent to `∑_{i=0}^{k-1} (cos(a_i + n) / 2^i) = 0`.
4. The goal is to find an integer `t` such that `m - n = t * π`.

**Key Idea:**
The condition `y(m) = 0` and `y(n) = 0` can be used to derive a relationship between `m` and `n` that is a multiple of `π`. 

However, the problem is simpler than it seems because the function `y(x)` is a finite sum of terms of the form `cos(a_i + x) / 2^i`, and the condition `y(m) = 0` is equivalent to `∑_{i=0}^{k-1} (cos(a_i + m) / 2^i) = 0`. 

But notice that if we set `x = m - n`, then `cos(a_i + x) = cos(a_i + m - n) = cos((a_i + m) - n) = cos(a_i + m) * cos(n) + sin(a_i + m) * sin(n)`. 

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a simpler relationship. 

Alternatively, observe that if we set `x = m` in `y(x)`, we get `y(m) = ∑_{i=0}^{k-1} (cos(a_i + m) / 2^i) = 0`. Similarly, `y(n) = ∑_{i=0}^{k-1} (cos(a_i + n) / 2^i) = 0`. 

But we need to find a relationship between `m` and `n` that is a multiple of `π`. 

Notice that if we can find a `t` such that `m - n = t * π`, then we are done. 

But we don't know if such a `t` exists. 

However, the problem is simpler than it seems because the function `y(x)` is a finite sum of terms of the form `cos(a_i + x) / 2^i`, and the condition `y(m) = 0` is equivalent to `∑_{i=0}^{k-1} (cos(a_i + m) / 2^i) = 0`. 

But notice that if we set `x = m - n`, then `cos(a_i + x) = cos(a_i + m - n) = cos((a_i + m) - n) = cos(a_i + m) * cos(n) + sin(a_i + m) * sin(n)`. 

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a simpler relationship. 

Alternatively, observe that if we set `x = m` in `y(x)`, we get `y(m) = ∑_{i=0}^{k-1} (cos(a_i + m) / 2^i) = 0`. Similarly, `y(n) = ∑_{i=0}^{k-1} (cos(a_i + n) / 2^i) = 0`.
