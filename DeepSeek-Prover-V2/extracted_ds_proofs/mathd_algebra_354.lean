### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given two equations:
1. \( a + 6d = 30 \)
2. \( a + 10d = 60 \)

We need to find \( a + 20d \).

#### Step 1: Subtract the first equation from the second
Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
Simplify:
\[ a + 10d - a - 6d = 30 \]
\[ 4d = 30 \]
\[ d = \frac{30}{4} = \frac{15}{2} \]

#### Step 2: Find \( a \) using \( d = \frac{15}{2} \)
Substitute \( d = \frac{15}{2} \) back into the first equation:
\[ a + 6 \cdot \frac{15}{2} = 30 \]
\[ a + 45 = 30 \]
\[ a = 30 - 45 = -15 \]

#### Step 3: Find \( a + 20d \)
Now, compute \( a + 20d \):
\[ a + 20d = -15 + 20 \cdot \frac{15}{2} \]
\[ = -15 + 150 \]
\[ = 135 \]

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Find \( d \)**:
   - Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( a \).
   - Solve for \( d \).

2. **Find \( a \)**:
   - Substitute the value of \( d \) back into the first equation to find \( a \).

3. **Find \( a + 20d \)**:
   - Substitute the values of \( a \) and \( d \) into the expression \( a + 20d \) and simplify.
