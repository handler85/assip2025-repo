### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
We need to prove that the sum of \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \) for \( k \) from 2 to 10000 is less than 198.

However, the Lean statement is slightly different:
- The sum is over `Finset.Icc 2 10000`, i.e., `k` from 2 to 10000 (inclusive).
- The term is `1 / Real.sqrt k`, but Lean's `/` is real division, and `Real.sqrt k` is the real square root.
- The Lean statement uses `1 / Real.sqrt k` (as a real number), not `1 / (Real.sqrt k : ℕ)` (as a natural number).

But wait, in Lean, `1 / Real.sqrt k` is interpreted as real division, and `Real.sqrt k` is the real square root. So the term is `1 / Real.sqrt k` as a real number.

But the problem is that `1 / Real.sqrt k` is not well-defined for `k = 0` or `k = 1` (or `k ≤ 1`). But in our case, `k` starts at `2`, so it's fine.

But the Lean statement is `∑ k in (Finset.Icc (2 : ℕ) 10000), (1 / Real.sqrt k) < 198`, which is correct.

#### Approach to the Proof

We need to bound the sum `∑_{k=2}^{10000} 1 / sqrt(k)`.

First, note that for `k ≥ 1`, `sqrt(k) ≥ 1`, so `1 / sqrt(k) ≤ 1`. But this is too weak.

A better bound is to note that `sqrt(k) ≥ sqrt(2)` for `k ≥ 2`, so `1 / sqrt(k) ≤ 1 / sqrt(2) ≈ 0.707`. But this is still too weak.

A better bound is to note that `sqrt(k) ≥ k / (k + 1)` for `k ≥ 1` (this can be shown by squaring both sides and simplifying). Then `1 / sqrt(k) ≤ (k + 1)/k = 1 + 1/k`.

But this is still not tight enough. A better bound is to note that `sqrt(k) ≥ (k + 1)/2` for `k ≥ 1` (this can be shown by squaring both sides and simplifying). Then `1 / sqrt(k) ≤ 2 / (k + 1)`.

But we can do better. A better bound is to note that `sqrt(k) ≥ (k + 1)/2` for `k ≥ 1` (as above). Then `1 / sqrt(k) ≤ 2 / (k + 1)`.

### Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to bound the sum of `1 / sqrt(k)` for `k` from `2` to `10000`.

2. **Bound the Sum**: We can use the fact that `sqrt(k) ≥ (k + 1)/2` for `k ≥ 1` to bound each term `1 / sqrt(k) ≤ 2 / (k + 1)`.

3. **Sum the Bounds**: The sum of `2 / (k + 1)` from `k = 2` to `10000` is `2 * (1 - 1/10001) = 2 * 10000 / 10001 ≈ 1.9998`.

4. **Final Bound**: The sum `1 / sqrt(k)` is bounded by `1.9998`.
