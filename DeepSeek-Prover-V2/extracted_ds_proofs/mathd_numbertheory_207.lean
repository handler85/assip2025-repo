### Detailed Proof

**Problem:** Convert \(852_9\) to base 10. Show that it is 695.

**Solution:**

First, recall that \(852_9\) is a number in base 9. To convert it to base 10, we need to express it in terms of powers of 9. The digits of \(852_9\) are \(8, 5, 2\) from left to right, so:

\[
852_9 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2
\]

Now, we compute each term:

1. \(9^2 = 81\)
2. \(8 \cdot 81 = 648\)
3. \(5 \cdot 9 = 45\)
4. \(648 + 45 = 693\)
5. \(693 + 2 = 695\)

Thus, \(852_9 = 695\) in base 10.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the notation:** \(852_9\) is a number in base 9, with digits 8, 5, 2 from left to right.
2. **Convert to base 10:**
   - Multiply the first digit (8) by \(9^2 = 81\).
   - Multiply the second digit (5) by \(9^1 = 9\).
   - Multiply the third digit (2) by \(9^0 = 1\).
   - Sum all the products.
3. **Calculate the sum:**
   - \(8 \cdot 81 = 648\)
   - \(5 \cdot 9 = 45\)
   - \(2 \cdot 1 = 2\)
   - \(648 + 45 = 693\)
   - \(693 + 2 = 695\)
4. **Final result:** \(852_9 = 695\) in base 10.
