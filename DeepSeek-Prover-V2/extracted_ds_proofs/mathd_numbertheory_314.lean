### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem:
1. `r = 1342 % 13`
2. `n` is a positive integer (`0 < n`).
3. `1342` divides `n` (`1342 ∣ n`).
4. The remainder when `n` is divided by `13` is less than `r` (`n % 13 < r`).
5. We need to prove that `n ≥ 6710`.

#### Step 1: Compute `r`
First, compute `1342 % 13`:
```
1342 ÷ 13 = 103 * 13 = 1339
1342 - 1339 = 3
```
So, `1342 % 13 = 3` and `r = 3`.

#### Step 2: Understand the condition `n % 13 < r`
Since `r = 3`, the condition becomes `n % 13 < 3`.

#### Step 3: Use the divisibility condition `1342 ∣ n`
Since `1342 ∣ n`, we can write `n = 1342 * k` for some positive integer `k` (because `n > 0`).

#### Step 4: Find the smallest `k` such that `n % 13 < 3`
We need to find the smallest `k` such that `(1342 * k) % 13 < 3`.

First, simplify `1342 % 13`:
```
1342 = 13 * 103 + 1
1342 % 13 = 1
```
Thus, `1342 ≡ 1 mod 13`.

Therefore, `n = 1342 * k ≡ 1 * k ≡ k mod 13`.

The condition `n % 13 < 3` becomes `k % 13 < 3`.

#### Step 5: Find the smallest `k` such that `k % 13 < 3`
The possible values of `k % 13` are `0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12`.

The condition `k % 13 < 3` is satisfied when `k % 13` is `0` or `1` or `2`.

Thus, the smallest `k` satisfying this condition is `k = 2` (`k % 13 = 2`).

#### Step 6: Find the smallest `n`
The smallest `k` is `2`, so the smallest `n` is `n = 1342 * 2 = 2684`.

But wait, we need to check if `k = 1` is possible.

For `k = 1`, `n = 1342 * 1 = 1342`.

Check the condition `n % 13 < 3`:
`1342 % 13 = 1339 + 3 = 1342 - 13 * 103 = 1342 - 1349 = -7`? No, this is incorrect.

Actually, `1342 ÷ 13 = 103 * 13 = 1339`, so `1342 - 1339 = 3`, so `1342 % 13 = 3`.

Thus, `k = 1` is invalid because `3 < 3` is false.

Similarly, for `k = 0`, `n = 0`, which is invalid because `n > 0`.

Thus, the smallest `k` is `2`, and the smallest `n` is `1342 * 2 = 2684`.

But wait, the problem states that `n ≥ 6710` is to be proved, and `2684 < 6710`.

This suggests that we have misunderstood the condition `n % 13 < r`.

#### Re-evaluating the condition `n % 13 < r`
Given `r = 3`, the condition is `n % 13 < 3`.

But `n = 1342 * k`, and `1342 % 13 = 1`, so `n % 13 = k % 13`.

Thus, the condition is `k % 13 < 3`.

The smallest `k` satisfying this is `k = 0`, but `k = 0` gives `n = 0`, which is invalid.

The next smallest `k` is `k = 1`, but `1 % 13 = 1 < 3` is true, but `n = 1342` is not `≥ 6710`.

The next `k` is `k = 2`, `2 % 13 = 2 < 3` is true, `n = 2684` is not `≥ 6710`.

The next `k` is `k = 3`, `3 % 13 = 3 < 3` is false.

Thus, the smallest `k` is `k = 3`, but `k = 3` gives `n = 1342 * 3 = 4026`, which is `≥ 6710`? No, `4026 < 6710`.

This suggests that the smallest `n` satisfying all conditions is `n = 6710`, because `6710 % 13 = 12 < 3` is false.

But `6710 % 13 = 12` is not `< 3`, so `n = 6710` is invalid.

The next `n` is `n = 1342 * 4 = 5352`, `5352 % 13 = 1 < 3` is true, `n = 5352` is `≥ 6710`? No.

The next `n` is `n = 1342 * 5 = 6700`, `6700 % 13 = 0 < 3` is true, `n = 6700` is `≥ 6710`? No.

The next `n` is `n = 1342 * 6 = 8042`, `8042 % 13 = 11 < 3` is false.

Thus, the smallest `n` satisfying all conditions is `n = 6700`, but `6700 < 6710`.

This suggests that there is no `n` satisfying all conditions and `n ≥ 6710`, or that the problem is incorrectly stated.

But the problem states that `n ≥ 6710` is to be proved, and we have found that `n = 6700` is a counterexample.

This means that the problem is incorrect as stated, or that there is a misunderstanding.

#### Re-evaluating the problem
Given that `1342 % 13 = 3`, the condition `n % 13 < 3` is `n % 13 ≤ 2`.

The smallest `n` satisfying `1342 ∣ n` and `n % 13 ≤ 2` is `n = 1342 * 0 = 0`, but `n > 0` is given.

The next `n` is `n = 1342 * 1 = 1342`, `1342 % 13 = 3 ≤ 2`? No.

The next `n` is `n = 1342 * 2 = 2684`, `2684 % 13 = 6 ≤ 2`? No.

The next `n` is `n = 1342 * 3 = 4026`, `4026 % 13 = 9 ≤ 2`? No.

The next `n` is `n = 1342 * 4 = 5368`, `5368 % 13 = 12 ≤ 2`? No.

The next `n` is `n = 1342 * 5 = 6710`, `6710 % 13 = 1 ≤ 2`? Yes.

Thus, the smallest `n` satisfying all conditions is `n = 6710`, and `n ≥ 6710` is true.

#### Conclusion
The smallest `n` satisfying all conditions is `n = 6710`, and `n ≥ 6710` is true.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We need to find the smallest positive integer `n` that is a multiple of `1342` and has a remainder less than `3` when divided by `13`.

2. **Compute `1342 % 13`**:
   - `1342 ÷ 13 = 103 * 13 = 1339`
   - `1342 - 1339 = 3`
   - So, `1342 % 13 = 3`.

3. **Find the Condition**:
   - The remainder when `n` is divided by `13` must be less than `3`, i.e., `n % 13 ≤ 2`.

4. **Find the Smallest `n`**:
   - The smallest `n` is `6710`, because:
     - `6710 ÷ 13 = 516 * 13 = 6708`
     - `6710 - 6708 = 2`
     - So, `6710 % 13 = 2 ≤ 2`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The smallest `n` satisfying all conditions is `6710`, and `n ≥ 6710` is true.
