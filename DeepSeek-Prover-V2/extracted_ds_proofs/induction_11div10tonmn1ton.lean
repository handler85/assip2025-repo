### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to prove that for any natural number `n`, `11` divides `10^n - (-1)^n` in the integers. 

#### Observations:
1. `(-1)^n` is `1` if `n` is even and `-1` if `n` is odd.
2. We can rewrite `10^n - (-1)^n` as `10^n - (1)` if `n` is even, and `10^n - (-1)` if `n` is odd.
3. We can simplify `10^n - (-1)^n` modulo `11` by using Fermat's Little Theorem, but it's not immediately clear how to apply it here.
4. Alternatively, we can compute `10^n - (-1)^n` directly for small values of `n` and observe a pattern:
   - For `n = 0`: `10^0 - (-1)^0 = 1 - 1 = 0` → divisible by `11`.
   - For `n = 1`: `10^1 - (-1)^1 = 10 - (-1) = 11` → divisible by `11`.
   - For `n = 2`: `10^2 - (-1)^2 = 100 - 1 = 99` → `99 = 9 * 11` → divisible by `11`.
   - For `n = 3`: `10^3 - (-1)^3 = 1000 - (-1) = 1001` → `1001 = 91 * 11` → divisible by `11`.
   - For `n = 4`: `10^4 - (-1)^4 = 10000 - 1 = 9999` → `9999 = 909 * 11` → divisible by `11`.
   - For `n = 5`: `10^5 - (-1)^5 = 100000 - (-1) = 100001` → `100001 = 9091 * 11` → divisible by `11`.

   From this pattern, it seems that `10^n - (-1)^n` is divisible by `11` for all `n ≥ 0`.

#### General Proof:
We can prove this by induction on `n`.

**Base case (`n = 0`):**
`10^0 - (-1)^0 = 1 - 1 = 0`, which is divisible by `11`.

**Inductive step (`n ≥ 0`):**
Assume that `10^n - (-1)^n` is divisible by `11`, i.e., `10^n - (-1)^n = 11 * k` for some integer `k`.

We need to show that `10^(n+1) - (-1)^(n+1)` is divisible by `11`.

Compute `10^(n+1) - (-1)^(n+1)`:
`10^(n+1) - (-1)^(n+1) = 10 * 10^n - (-1) * (-1)^n = 10 * 10^n - (-1)^n` (since `(-1) * (-1)^n = (-1)^(n+1) = (-1)^n`).

But `10 * 10^n = 10^n * 10 = 10^n * (11 - 1) = 10^n * 11 - 10^n = 11 * 10^n - 10^n`.

Thus, `10^(n+1) - (-1)^(n+1) = (11 * 10^n - 10^n) - (-1)^n = 11 * 10^n - 10^n + (-1)^n = 11 * 10^n - (10^n - (-1)^n)`.

But `10^n - (-1)^n` is divisible by `11` by the inductive hypothesis, so `10^n - (-1)^n = 11 * m` for some integer `m`.

Thus, `10^(n+1) - (-1)^(n+1) = 11 * 10^n - 11 * m = 11 * (10^n - m)`, which is divisible by `11`.

This completes the inductive step, and the proof by induction.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Base Case (`n = 0`):**
   - Compute `10^0 - (-1)^0 = 1 - 1 = 0`, which is divisible by `11`.

2. **Inductive Step (`n ≥ 0`):**
   - Assume `10^n - (-1)^n` is divisible by `11` (inductive hypothesis).
   - Express `10^(n+1) - (-1)^(n+1)` in terms of `10^n - (-1)^n` and use the inductive hypothesis to show divisibility by `11`.
