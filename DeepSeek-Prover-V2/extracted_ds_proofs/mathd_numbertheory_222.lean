### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the following properties of the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD):
1. For any two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), we have:
   \[
   \text{lcm}(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, b) = a \cdot b.
   \]
2. The GCD of two numbers divides both numbers, i.e., \(\gcd(a, b) \mid a\) and \(\gcd(a, b) \mid b\).

#### Step 1: Use the LCM-GCD Product Identity
Given \(a = 120\), \(\text{lcm}(120, b) = 3720\), and \(\gcd(120, b) = 8\), we can use the identity:
\[
\text{lcm}(120, b) \cdot \gcd(120, b) = 120 \cdot b.
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
3720 \cdot 8 = 120 \cdot b.
\]
Calculate \(3720 \cdot 8\):
\[
3720 \cdot 8 = 29760.
\]
Thus:
\[
29760 = 120 \cdot b.
\]
Divide both sides by \(120\):
\[
b = \frac{29760}{120} = 248.
\]

#### Step 2: Verification
We can verify that \(b = 248\) satisfies the original conditions:
1. \(\gcd(120, 248) = 8\) (since \(248 = 120 \cdot 2 + 8\) and \(120 = 8 \cdot 15 + 0\), but this is incorrect. Let's recompute \(\gcd(120, 248)\):
   - \(248 = 120 \cdot 2 + 8\)
   - \(120 = 8 \cdot 15 + 0\)
   So \(\gcd(120, 248) = 8\).)
2. \(\text{lcm}(120, 248) = \frac{120 \cdot 248}{\gcd(120, 248)} = \frac{120 \cdot 248}{8} = 120 \cdot 31 = 3720\).

Thus, the solution is correct.

### Step 3: Abstract Plan

1. **Use the LCM-GCD Identity**:
   - The product of the LCM and GCD of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers.
   - Substitute the given values to find \(b\).

2. **Calculate \(b\)**:
   - Compute \(3720 \cdot 8 = 29760\).
   - Divide by \(120\) to get \(b = 248\).

3. **Verify the Solution**:
   - Check that \(\gcd(120, 248) = 8\) and \(\text{lcm}(120, 248) = 3720\).
