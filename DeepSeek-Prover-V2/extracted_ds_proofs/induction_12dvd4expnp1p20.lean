### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to prove that for any natural number `n`, `12` divides `4^(n+1) + 20`. 

#### Key Observations:
1. `12 = 3 * 4`, and `3` and `4` are coprime. So, `12` divides a number if and only if both `3` and `4` divide that number.
2. We can check divisibility by `3` and `4` separately.

#### Checking Divisibility by `4`:
- `4^(n+1)` is divisible by `4` for all `n ≥ 0` because `4` is a factor of `4^(n+1)`.
- `20` is divisible by `4` because `20 = 4 * 5`.
- Therefore, `4^(n+1) + 20` is divisible by `4`.

#### Checking Divisibility by `3`:
- We can use the fact that `4 ≡ 1 mod 3`, so `4^(n+1) ≡ 1^(n+1) ≡ 1 mod 3`.
- `20 ≡ 2 mod 3` because `20 = 3 * 6 + 2`.
- Therefore, `4^(n+1) + 20 ≡ 1 + 2 ≡ 3 ≡ 0 mod 3`.
- Hence, `4^(n+1) + 20` is divisible by `3`.

#### Conclusion:
Since `4^(n+1) + 20` is divisible by both `3` and `4`, and `3` and `4` are coprime, it is divisible by `12`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Prove Divisibility by 4**:
   - `4^(n+1)` is divisible by 4.
   - `20` is divisible by 4.
   - Therefore, `4^(n+1) + 20` is divisible by 4.

2. **Prove Divisibility by 3**:
   - `4 ≡ 1 mod 3`, so `4^(n+1) ≡ 1 mod 3`.
   - `20 ≡ 2 mod 3`, so `4^(n+1) + 20 ≡ 3 ≡ 0 mod 3`.
   - Therefore, `4^(n+1) + 20` is divisible by 3.

3. **Combine Results**:
   - Since `4^(n+1) + 20` is divisible by both 3 and 4, and 3 and 4 are coprime, it is divisible by `12`.
