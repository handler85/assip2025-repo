### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the given equations:
1. `2^a = 32`
2. `a^b = 125`

Then, we need to compute `b^a` and show that it equals `243`.

#### Step 1: Solve for `a` in `2^a = 32`

We know that `32 = 2^5`, so:
`2^a = 2^5`

Since the bases are the same and greater than `1`, we can equate the exponents:
`a = 5`

#### Step 2: Solve for `b` in `a^b = 125`

Substitute `a = 5` into the equation:
`5^b = 125`

We know that `125 = 5^3`, so:
`5^b = 5^3`

Again, since the bases are the same and greater than `1`, we can equate the exponents:
`b = 3`

#### Step 3: Compute `b^a`

Substitute `b = 3` and `a = 5`:
`b^a = 3^5 = 243`

This completes the proof.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Find `a` from `2^a = 32`**:
   - Recognize that `32 = 2^5`.
   - Deduce that `a = 5`.

2. **Find `b` from `a^b = 125`**:
   - Substitute `a = 5` to get `5^b = 125`.
   - Recognize that `125 = 5^3`.
   - Deduce that `b = 3`.

3. **Compute `b^a`**:
   - Substitute `b = 3` and `a = 5` to get `3^5 = 243`.
