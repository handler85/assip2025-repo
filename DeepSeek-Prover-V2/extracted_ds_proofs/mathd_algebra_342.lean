### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the problem:
- We have an arithmetic series with first term `a` and common difference `d`.
- The sum of the first 5 terms is `70`.
- The sum of the first 10 terms is `210`.
- We need to find the first term `a` and show that it is `42/5`.

#### Step 1: Express the Sums in Terms of `a` and `d`

The sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (2a + (n - 1)d) \]

For `n = 5`:
\[ S_5 = \frac{5}{2} \cdot (2a + 4d) = 70 \]
\[ 5(2a + 4d) = 140 \]
\[ 2a + 4d = 28 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \]

For `n = 10`:
\[ S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \cdot (2a + 9d) = 210 \]
\[ 5(2a + 9d) = 210 \]
\[ 2a + 9d = 42 \quad \text{(Equation 2)} \]

#### Step 2: Solve the System of Equations

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:
\[ (2a + 9d) - (2a + 4d) = 42 - 28 \]
\[ 5d = 14 \]
\[ d = \frac{14}{5} \]

Substitute `d = 14/5` back into Equation 1:
\[ 2a + 4 \cdot \frac{14}{5} = 28 \]
\[ 2a + \frac{56}{5} = 28 \]
Multiply both sides by `5`:
\[ 10a + 56 = 140 \]
\[ 10a = 84 \]
\[ a = \frac{84}{10} = \frac{42}{5} \]

#### Verification

1. For `n = 5`:
   \[ S_5 = \frac{5}{2} \cdot (2 \cdot \frac{42}{5} + 4 \cdot \frac{14}{5}) = \frac{5}{2} \cdot ( \frac{84}{5} + \frac{56}{5} ) = \frac{5}{2} \cdot \frac{140}{5} = \frac{5 \cdot 140}{10} = 70 \]

2. For `n = 10`:
   \[ S_{10} = 5 \cdot (2 \cdot \frac{42}{5} + 9 \cdot \frac{14}{5}) = 5 \cdot ( \frac{84}{5} + \frac{126}{5} ) = 5 \cdot \frac{210}{5} = 210 \]

### Step 3: Abstract Plan

1. **Express the Sums Mathematically**:
   - Write the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series in terms of `a` and `d`.
   - For `n = 5` and `n = 10`, set up the equations based on the given sums.

2. **Solve the System of Equations**:
   - Subtract the two equations to eliminate `a` and find `d`.
   - Substitute `d` back into one of the original equations to find `a`.

3. **Verify the Solution**:
   - Plug `a` and `d` back into the original equations to ensure they hold true.
