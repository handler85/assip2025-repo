### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's carefully restate the problem and understand the notation.

**Problem Statement:**
For a sequence `{a_n}` of non-negative real numbers, we have:
\[ \sum_{n=0}^{99} a_{n+1}^2 = 1. \]
We need to show that:
\[ \sum_{n=0}^{98} (a_{n+1}^2 a_{n+2}) + a_{100}^2 a_1 < \frac{12}{25}. \]

**Notation Clarification:**
1. The sum `∑ x in Finset.range 100, ((a (x + 1))^2)` is `a_1² + a_2² + ... + a_{100}² = 1` because `Finset.range 100` is `{0, ..., 99}`, and `x + 1` gives `{1, ..., 100}`.
2. The sum `∑ x in Finset.range 99, ((a (x + 1))^2 * a (x + 2))` is `a_1² a_2 + a_2² a_3 + ... + a_{99}² a_{100}`.
3. The term `(a 100)^2 * a 1` is `a_{100}² a_1`.

**Key Observations:**
1. The sum `∑_{n=0}^{99} a_{n+1}^2` is `1`, so each `a_i^2` is `≤ 1` (since all terms are non-negative).
2. The sum `∑_{n=0}^{98} (a_{n+1}^2 a_{n+2})` is `≤ ∑_{n=0}^{98} a_{n+1}^2 = 1` because `a_{n+2} ≤ 1` (as `a_{n+2}^2 ≤ 1`).
3. The term `(a 100)^2 * a 1` is `≤ a_{100}^2` because `a_1 ≤ 1` (as `a_1^2 ≤ 1`). But `a_{100}^2 ≤ 1` because `a_{100}^2 ≤ ∑_{k=1}^{100} a_k^2 = 1`.

But we can do better:
- The term `(a 100)^2 * a 1` is `≤ a_{100}^2` because `a_1 ≤ 1` (as `a_1^2 ≤ 1`).
- But `a_{100}^2 ≤ 1` because `a_{100}^2 ≤ ∑_{k=1}^{100} a_k^2 = 1`.

But we can also use the fact that `a_{n+1}^2 ≤ 1` to get a better bound:
- The term `(a 100)^2 * a 1` is `≤ a_{100}^2 * a_1` (but this is not directly helpful).
