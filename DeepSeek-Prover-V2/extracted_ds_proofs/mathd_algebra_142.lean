### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given two equations involving the real numbers `m` and `b`:
1. `m * 7 + b = -1`
2. `m * (-1) + b = 7`

We need to prove that `m + b = 5`.

**Approach:**
First, simplify the given equations to express `b` in terms of `m` or vice versa. Then, substitute the expression for `b` into the other equation to find `m`, and finally compute `m + b`.

Alternatively, we can subtract the two given equations to eliminate `b` and solve for `m`, and then find `b` and `m + b`.

**Detailed Solution:**

1. Subtract the second equation from the first:
   \[
   (m \cdot 7 + b) - (m \cdot (-1) + b) = -1 - 7
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   m \cdot 7 + b - m \cdot (-1) - b = 7m + b + m - b = 8m
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   -1 - 7 = -8
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   8m = -8
   \]
   Divide both sides by `8`:
   \[
   m = -1
   \]

2. Substitute `m = -1` back into the first equation to find `b`:
   \[
   m \cdot 7 + b = -1
   \]
   \[
   (-1) \cdot 7 + b = -1
   \]
   \[
   -7 + b = -1
   \]
   Add `7` to both sides:
   \[
   b = 6
   \]

3. Compute `m + b`:
   \[
   m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
   \]

Thus, we have `m + b = 5`.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Subtract the Two Given Equations**:
   - Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate `b` and solve for `m`.

2. **Find `m`**:
   - Simplify the resulting equation to find `m = -1`.

3. **Find `b`**:
   - Substitute `m = -1` back into one of the original equations to find `b = 6`.

4. **Compute `m + b`**:
   - Add `m` and `b` to get `m + b = 5`.
