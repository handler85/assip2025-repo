### Detailed Proof

**Problem:** Evaluate \(\log_3 27\) and show that it is \(3\).

**Solution:**

1. Recall that \(\log_b a = \frac{\ln a}{\ln b}\). Thus, \(\log_3 27 = \frac{\ln 27}{\ln 3}\).

2. We know that \(27 = 3^3\). Therefore, \(\ln 27 = \ln (3^3) = 3 \ln 3\).

3. Substitute this into the expression for \(\log_3 27\):
   \[
   \log_3 27 = \frac{\ln 27}{\ln 3} = \frac{3 \ln 3}{\ln 3} = 3.
   \]

This completes the proof.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Express the logarithm in terms of natural logarithms:**
   - \(\log_3 27 = \frac{\ln 27}{\ln 3}\).

2. **Simplify the numerator using exponent rules:**
   - \(27 = 3^3\), so \(\ln 27 = 3 \ln 3\).

3. **Substitute and simplify the fraction:**
   - \(\frac{\ln 27}{\ln 3} = \frac{3 \ln 3}{\ln 3} = 3\).
