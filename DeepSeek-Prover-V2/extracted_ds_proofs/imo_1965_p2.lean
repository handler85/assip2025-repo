### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem. We have a system of linear equations in variables \(x, y, z\) with coefficients \(a_i\) (for \(i \in \mathbb{N}\)) satisfying certain conditions:
1. \(a_0, a_4, a_8 > 0\),
2. \(a_1, a_2 < 0\),
3. \(a_3, a_5 < 0\),
4. \(a_6, a_7 < 0\),
5. \(a_0 + a_1 + a_2 > 0\),
6. \(a_3 + a_4 + a_5 > 0\),
7. \(a_6 + a_7 + a_8 > 0\).

We are to prove that the only solution to the system is \(x = y = z = 0\).

#### Key Observations:
1. The coefficients \(a_i\) are real numbers, and the system is linear.
2. The conditions on the coefficients are symmetric in a cyclic manner.
3. The system is homogeneous, so \((0, 0, 0)\) is always a solution. We need to show that it is the only solution.

#### Approach:
To show that \((0, 0, 0)\) is the only solution, we can assume that \((x, y, z) \neq (0, 0, 0)\) and derive a contradiction. However, since the system is homogeneous, we can also use the fact that the coefficients are positive and negative in a controlled way to show that the only solution is trivial.

But a more straightforward approach is to use the **linear dependence** of the vectors \((x, y, z)\) and the given conditions. The system can be written as:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a_0 & a_1 & a_2 \\
a_3 & a_4 & a_5 \\
a_6 & a_7 & a_8
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\ y \\ z
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
The determinant of the coefficient matrix is:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
a_0 & a_1 & a_2 \\
a_3 & a_4 & a_5 \\
a_6 & a_7 & a_8
\end{vmatrix}
=
a_0 (a_4 a_8 - a_5 a_7) - a_1 (a_3 a_8 - a_5 a_6) + a_2 (a_3 a_7 - a_4 a_6).
\]
This determinant is not obviously zero, but we can bound it using the given conditions.

#### Bounding the Determinant:
We can use the given conditions to bound the determinant. For example, using the fact that \(a_0, a_4, a_8 > 0\) and \(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_5, a_6, a_7 < 0\), we can derive bounds for the terms in the determinant.

However, this seems complicated, and we might not need the exact determinant. Instead, we can use the **Rouché-Capelli theorem** or **Cramer's rule** to find the solution, but since the determinant is not obviously zero, we might need to find another approach.

#### Alternative Approach:
Instead of trying to find the determinant, we can use the given conditions to show that the only solution is \((0, 0, 0)\).

1. From the first equation: \(a_0 x + a_1 y + a_2 z = 0\).
2. From the second equation: \(a_3 x + a_4 y + a_5 z = 0\).
3. From the third equation: \(a_6 x + a_7 y + a_8 z = 0\).

We can use the fact that \(a_0, a_4, a_8 > 0\) and the other coefficients are negative to show that the only solution is \((0, 0, 0)\).

For example, suppose \(x \neq 0\). Then from the first equation, we can write:
\[
a_0 x = -a_1 y - a_2 z.
\]
Since \(a_0 > 0\) and \(x \neq 0\), the left side is non-zero. The right side is a linear combination of \(y\) and \(z\) with negative coefficients, so it cannot be zero unless \(y = z = 0\). But if \(y = z = 0\), then from the first equation, \(a_0 x = 0\), so \(x = 0\) (since \(a_0 > 0\)). This is a contradiction, so \(x = 0\).

Similarly, we can show that \(y = 0\) and \(z = 0\).

#### Summary of the Proof:
1. Assume \(x \neq 0\) and derive a contradiction using the given equations and the positivity of \(a_0\) and negativity of the other coefficients.
2. Similarly, assume \(y \neq 0\) and derive a contradiction.
3. Similarly, assume \(z \neq 0\) and derive a contradiction.
4. Conclude that \(x = y = z = 0\) is the only solution.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Assume \(x \neq 0\) and derive a contradiction**:
   - From \(a_0 x + a_1 y + a_2 z = 0\) and \(x \neq 0\), \(a_0 > 0\), we get \(a_0 x = -a_1 y - a_2 z\).
   - Since \(a_1, a_2 < 0\), the right side is a positive linear combination of \(y\) and \(z\) (if \(y, z \geq 0\)), but we can show that it cannot be zero unless \(y = z = 0\) (contradicting \(x \neq 0\)).

2. **Similarly, assume \(y \neq 0\) and derive a contradiction**:
   - From \(a_3 x + a_4 y + a_5 z = 0\) and \(y \neq 0\), \(a_4 > 0\), we get \(a_4 y = -a_3 x - a_5 z\).
   - Since \(a_3, a_5 < 0\), the right side is a positive linear combination of \(x\) and \(z\) (if \(x, z \geq 0\)), but we can show that it cannot be zero unless \(x = z = 0\) (contradicting \(y \neq 0\)).

3. **Similarly, assume \(z \neq 0\) and derive a contradiction**:
   - From \(a_6 x + a_7 y + a_8 z = 0\) and \(z \neq 0\), \(a_8 > 0\), we get \(a_8 z = -a_6 x - a_7 y\).
   - Since \(a_6, a_7 < 0\), the right side is a positive linear combination of \(x\) and \(y\) (if \(x, y \geq 0\)), but we can show that it cannot be zero unless \(x = y = 0\) (contradicting \(z \neq 0\)).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The only possibility is \(x = y = z = 0\).
