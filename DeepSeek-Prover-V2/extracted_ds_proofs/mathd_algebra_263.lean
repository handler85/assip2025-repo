### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given:
1. \( 19 + 3y \geq 0 \) (since the square root is real),
2. \( \sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7 \).

We need to prove that \( y = 10 \).

**Key Observations:**
1. The square root condition \( \sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7 \) implies that \( 19 + 3y = 49 \) (since the square root of a non-negative number is the non-negative number whose square is the original number).
2. The condition \( 19 + 3y \geq 0 \) is redundant because \( 19 + 3y = 49 \geq 0 \).
3. The equation \( 19 + 3y = 49 \) can be solved for \( y \).

**Proof Sketch:**
1. Square both sides of \( \sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7 \) to get \( 19 + 3y = 49 \).
2. Solve for \( y \): \( 3y = 30 \), so \( y = 10 \).
3. Verify that \( 19 + 3 \cdot 10 = 49 \geq 0 \), which is true.

**Verification of \( 19 + 3y \geq 0 \):**
Since \( 19 + 3y = 49 \geq 0 \), the condition is automatically satisfied.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Square both sides of the equation** \( \sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7 \) to eliminate the square root, obtaining \( 19 + 3y = 49 \).
2. **Solve for \( y \)** by subtracting 19 from both sides: \( 3y = 30 \).
3. **Divide by 3** to get \( y = 10 \).
4. **Verify the solution** by substituting \( y = 10 \) back into the original equation to ensure it holds.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements
