### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall that the **modulus** (or remainder) of `a` divided by `b` is the unique integer `r` such that:
1. `0 ≤ r < b`
2. `a = b * q + r` for some integer `q` (the quotient).

In Lean, `a % b` is defined as the unique `r` such that `0 ≤ r < b` and `a = b * q + r` for some `q` (specifically, `q = a / b`).

#### Problem: Prove that `54 % 6 = 0`

1. **Find the quotient `q` and remainder `r`**:
   - We know that `54 = 6 * 9 + 0` because `6 * 9 = 54` and `0 ≤ 0 < 6`.
   - Here, `q = 9` and `r = 0`.

2. **Verify the conditions**:
   - `0 ≤ 0 < 6` is true.
   - `54 = 6 * 9 + 0` is true.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - By definition, `54 % 6 = 0`.

#### Why is `54 % 6 = 0`?

Because `54` is exactly divisible by `6` (`54 / 6 = 9`). The remainder is `0`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the problem**: We need to find the remainder of `54` when divided by `6`, i.e., `54 % 6`.

2. **Check divisibility**:
   - `6 * 9 = 54` is true.
   - Therefore, `54` is exactly divisible by `6`, and the remainder is `0`.

3. **Conclusion**: `54 % 6 = 0`.
