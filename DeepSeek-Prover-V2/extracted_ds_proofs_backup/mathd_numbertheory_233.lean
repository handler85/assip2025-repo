### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the modular inverse of `24` modulo `121` (`11²`), i.e., a number `b` such that `24 * b ≡ 1 mod 121`. 

#### Step 1: Find the Inverse Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm
We need to find integers `x` and `y` such that:
\[ 24x + 121y = 1 \]
This is equivalent to finding `x ≡ 24⁻¹ mod 121`.

First, perform the Euclidean algorithm to find `gcd(24, 121)`:
1. `121 = 5 * 24 + 1`
2. `24 = 24 * 1 + 0`

The `gcd` is `1`, so an inverse exists.

Now, back-substitute to express `1` as a linear combination of `24` and `121`:
1. `1 = 121 - 5 * 24`

Thus, the inverse is `x = -5 ≡ 116 mod 121` (since `-5 + 121 = 116`).

#### Step 2: Verification
Check that `24 * 116 ≡ 1 mod 121`:
\[ 24 * 116 = 2784 \]
\[ 2784 ÷ 121 = 23 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
Thus, `2784 ≡ 1 mod 121`, so `116` is indeed the inverse of `24` modulo `121`.

### Step 3: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the modular inverse of `24` modulo `121`, i.e., a number `b` such that `24 * b ≡ 1 mod 121`.

2. **Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**:
   - Compute `gcd(24, 121) = 1` to confirm that an inverse exists.
   - Find integers `x` and `y` such that `24 * x + 121 * y = 1`.
   - The inverse is `x ≡ 24⁻¹ mod 121`.

3. **Back-Substitute**:
   - From `24 * x + 121 * y = 1`, we have `24 * x ≡ 1 mod 121`.
   - The inverse is `x ≡ 116 mod 121`.

4. **Verification**:
   - Check that `24 * 116 ≡ 1 mod 121` by direct computation.

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have`

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_233 (b : ZMod (11 ^ 2)) (h₀ : b = 24⁻¹) : b = 116 := by
  have h₁ : (24 : ZMod (11 ^ 2)) * 116 = 1 := by sorry
  have h₂ : b = 116 := by sorry
  exact h₂
```

### Explanation:
1. `h₁`: This is the key computational step, showing that `24 * 116 ≡ 1 mod 121`. This is the verification step.
2. `h₂`: Using the definition of `b` (`b = 24⁻¹`) and the fact that `116` is the inverse of `24` modulo `121`, we conclude that `b = 116`.
