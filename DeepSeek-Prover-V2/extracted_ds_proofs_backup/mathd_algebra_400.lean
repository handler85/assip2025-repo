### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We have the equation:
\[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]

Simplify the left-hand side (LHS):
\[ 5 + 5 \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55 \]

But wait, the original LHS is:
\[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 5 + 5 \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55 \]

But the RHS is:
\[ \frac{110}{100} \times x = 1.1 \times x \]

So the equation is:
\[ 55 = 1.1 \times x \]

To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by \( 1.1 \):
\[ x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50 \]

But let's verify the arithmetic carefully.

1. The LHS is:
   \[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 5 + 5 \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55 \]

2. The RHS is:
   \[ \frac{110}{100} \times x = 1.1 \times x \]

3. The equation is:
   \[ 55 = 1.1 \times x \]

4. Solve for \( x \):
   \[ x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50 \]

This is correct.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the LHS**:
   - Compute \( \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 50 \).
   - Add \( 5 + 50 = 55 \).

2. **Simplify the RHS**:
   - Compute \( \frac{110}{100} = 1.1 \).
   - The RHS is \( 1.1 \times x \).

3. **Set up the equation**:
   - \( 55 = 1.1 \times x \).

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by \( 1.1 \): \( x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50 \).
