### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the problem:
- We have two positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m > 1 \), \( n > 1 \), and \( m \cdot n = 2005 \).
- We need to prove that \( m + n = 406 \).

#### Step 1: Factorize 2005
First, factorize 2005 to find all possible pairs \((m, n)\):
\[ 2005 = 5 \times 401 \]
Since 401 is a prime number, the positive divisors of 2005 are:
\[ 1, 5, 401, 2005 \]
But \( m > 1 \) and \( n > 1 \), so the possible pairs \((m, n)\) are:
\[ (5, 401), (401, 5) \]

#### Step 2: Compute Sums
For each pair, compute the sum:
1. \( m = 5 \), \( n = 401 \):
   \[ m + n = 5 + 401 = 406 \]
2. \( m = 401 \), \( n = 5 \):
   \[ m + n = 401 + 5 = 406 \]

In both cases, the sum is \( 406 \).

#### Step 3: Verification
We must ensure that no other pairs \((m, n)\) are possible. The only positive divisors of 2005 are 1, 5, 401, and 2005. Since \( m > 1 \) and \( n > 1 \), the only possible pairs are \((5, 401)\) and \((401, 5)\).

### Step 4: Abstract Plan
1. **Factorize 2005**:
   - Find all positive divisors of 2005.
   - Since 2005 = 5 × 401 and 401 is prime, the divisors are 1, 5, 401, 2005.

2. **List Valid Pairs**:
   - Since \( m > 1 \) and \( n > 1 \), the possible pairs \((m, n)\) are \((5, 401)\) and \((401, 5)\).

3. **Compute Sums**:
   - For \((5, 401)\), \( m + n = 406 \).
   - For \((401, 5)\), \( m + n = 406 \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The only possible sum is \( 406 \).

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have`

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_541 (m n : ℕ) (h₀ : 1 < m) (h₁ : 1 < n) (h₂ : m * n = 2005) :
    m + n = 406 := by
  have h_main : m = 5 ∧ n = 401 ∨ m = 401 ∧ n = 5 := by
    sorry
  have h_final : m + n = 406 := by
    sorry
  exact h_final
```

### Explanation:
1. `h_main`: This `have` statement captures that the only possible pairs \((m, n)\) are \((5, 401)\) and \((401, 5)\). The proof of this is straightforward from the factorization of 2005 and the constraints on \(m\) and \(n\).
2. `h_final`: This `have` statement uses `h_main` to conclude that \(m + n = 406\). The proof is straightforward by case analysis on the disjunction in `h_main`.
