### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to compute \(91^2\) in our head and verify that it equals \(8281\). 

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are given \(91^2\) and need to prove that it is \(8281\). 

#### Step 2: Compute \(91^2\)
Recall that squaring a number is equivalent to multiplying the number by itself. So, we can write:
\[ 91^2 = 91 \times 91 \]

#### Step 3: Multiply \(91 \times 91\)
To multiply \(91 \times 91\), we can use the distributive property or the FOIL method for binomials. 

First, note that:
\[ 91 = 100 - 9 \]

Now, compute:
\[ 91 \times 91 = (100 - 9) \times (100 - 9) \]

Using the identity \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\), we get:
\[ (100 - 9)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \times 100 \times 9 + 9^2 \]
\[ = 10000 - 1800 + 81 \]
\[ = 8281 \]

Thus, \(91^2 = 8281\).

#### Step 4: Verification
We can verify the calculation by checking each step:
1. \(100^2 = 10000\)
2. \(2 \times 100 \times 9 = 1800\)
3. \(9^2 = 81\)
4. Subtract: \(10000 - 1800 = 8200\)
5. Add: \(8200 + 81 = 8281\)

This confirms that \(91^2 = 8281\).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to compute \(91^2\) and verify it equals \(8281\).
2. **Expand the Square**: Express \(91^2\) as \((100 - 9)^2\) to use the binomial expansion.
3. **Apply the Binomial Formula**: Use \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\) to expand \((100 - 9)^2\).
4. **Calculate Each Term**:
   - \(100^2 = 10000\)
   - \(2 \times 100 \times 9 = 1800\)
   - \(9^2 = 81\)
5. **Combine the Results**: Subtract \(1800\) from \(10000\) to get \(8200\), then add \(81\) to get \(8281\).
6. **Final Verification**: Confirm that \(8281\) is indeed the correct value of \(91^2\).

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4

```

This `have` statement directly reflects the final result we derived. The `sorry` placeholder can be replaced with the detailed calculation we outlined earlier.
