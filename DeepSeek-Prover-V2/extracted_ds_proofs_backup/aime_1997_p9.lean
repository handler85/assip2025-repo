### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's recall the problem:
We have a positive real number `a` such that:
1. `2 < a² < 3`,
2. `〈a⁻¹〉 = 〈a²〉`, where `〈x〉 = x - ⌊x⌋` is the fractional part of `x`,
3. We need to find the value of `a¹² - 144 * a⁻¹` and show that it is `233`.

#### Key Observations:
1. The fractional part of `x` is `〈x〉 = x - ⌊x⌋` and `0 ≤ 〈x〉 < 1`.
2. The condition `〈a⁻¹〉 = 〈a²〉` can be rewritten as:
   \[
   a^{-1} - \lfloor a^{-1} \rfloor = a^2 - \lfloor a^2 \rfloor.
   \]
3. The inequalities `2 < a² < 3` imply that `1 < a < \sqrt{3}`.
4. The condition `〈a⁻¹〉 = 〈a²〉` is restrictive because `a²` is very close to `2` and `a` is close to `\sqrt{2}`.

#### Step 1: Find `⌊a²⌋` and `⌊a⁻¹⌋`
Given `2 < a² < 3`, we have `⌊a²⌋ = 2`.

Similarly, since `1 < a < \sqrt{3}`, we have `1/a > 1/\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3}/3 ≈ 0.577` and `1/a < 1/1 = 1`. But we need a tighter bound.

From `2 < a² < 3`, we get `\sqrt{2} < a < \sqrt{3}`. Then:
\[
1/a > 1/\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3}/3 ≈ 0.577, \quad \text{and} \quad 1/a < 1/\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2}/2 ≈ 0.707.
\]
But we can do better. Since `a² > 2`, we have `a > \sqrt{2} ≈ 1.414`, so `1/a < 1/\sqrt{2} ≈ 0.707`.

But we need `⌊a⁻¹⌋`. Since `a < \sqrt{3} ≈ 1.732`, we have `1/a > 1/\sqrt{3} ≈ 0.577`.

But we can find `⌊a⁻¹⌋` more precisely.

#### Step 2: Find `⌊a⁻¹⌋`
We have `a² > 2` and `a² < 3`, so `a > \sqrt{2} ≈ 1.414` and `a < \sqrt{3} ≈ 1.732`.

Thus:
\[
1/a < 1/\sqrt{2} ≈ 0.707, \quad \text{and} \quad 1/a > 1/\sqrt{3} ≈ 0.577.
\]
But we can find `⌊a⁻¹⌋` more precisely.
