### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the problem:
- We have two natural numbers, `a = 120` and `b`, such that:
  1. `lcm(a, b) = 3720`
  2. `gcd(a, b) = 8`
- We need to find `b` and show that it is `248`.

#### Key Observations:
1. The product of the `lcm` and `gcd` of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves:
   \[
   \text{lcm}(a, b) \cdot \gcd(a, b) = a \cdot b.
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   3720 \cdot 8 = 120 \cdot b.
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   3720 \cdot 8 = 29760.
   \]
   So:
   \[
   29760 = 120 \cdot b.
   \]
   Dividing both sides by `120`:
   \[
   b = \frac{29760}{120} = 248.
   \]
   This directly gives `b = 248`.

2. We can also verify that `gcd(120, 248) = 8` and `lcm(120, 248) = 3720`:
   - `120 = 8 * 15` and `248 = 8 * 31`, so `gcd(120, 248) = 8 * gcd(15, 31) = 8 * 1 = 8`.
   - `lcm(120, 248) = 8 * lcm(15, 31) = 8 * 465 = 3720` (since `15 * 31 = 465` and `gcd(15, 31) = 1`).

#### Step 1: Abstract Plan
1. Use the identity `lcm(a, b) * gcd(a, b) = a * b` to derive `b = 248`.
2. Substitute the given values to get `3720 * 8 = 120 * b`.
3. Simplify to `29760 = 120 * b` and then `b = 248`.

#### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4

  have h_main : b = 248 := by
