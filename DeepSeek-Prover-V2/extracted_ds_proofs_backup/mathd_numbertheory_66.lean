### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the remainder of 194 when divided by 11. This means we want to find the unique integer \( r \) such that \( 0 \leq r < 11 \) and \( 194 \equiv r \mod 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Modulo Operation
The modulo operation \( a \mod b \) gives the remainder when \( a \) is divided by \( b \). The remainder \( r \) must satisfy \( 0 \leq r < b \).

#### Step 2: Compute \( 194 \mod 11 \)
We can perform the division of 194 by 11 to find the remainder.

1. \( 11 \times 17 = 187 \)
2. Subtract: \( 194 - 187 = 7 \)
3. Since \( 7 < 11 \), the remainder is \( 7 \).

Thus, \( 194 \mod 11 = 7 \).

#### Step 3: Verification
We can also verify this by checking that \( 194 = 11 \times 17 + 7 \), which is clearly true:
\[ 11 \times 17 = 187 \]
\[ 194 - 187 = 7 \]

#### Step 4: Conclusion
The remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 7.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the remainder of 194 when divided by 11.
2. **Find the Quotient**: Compute \( 194 \div 11 \) to find the largest integer \( q \) such that \( 11 \times q \leq 194 \).
   - \( 11 \times 17 = 187 \leq 194 \).
   - \( 11 \times 18 = 198 > 194 \).
   - So, \( q = 17 \).
3. **Find the Remainder**: Subtract the product of the quotient and the divisor from the original number to find the remainder.
   - \( 194 - 11 \times 17 = 194 - 187 = 7 \).
4. **Verify the Remainder**: Ensure that the remainder is less than the divisor.
   - \( 7 < 11 \).
5. **Conclusion**: The remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 7.

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by
  have h_main : 194 % 11 = 7 := by sorry
  sorry
```

This `have` statement directly reflects the final result we derived, and the proof can be completed by using the `norm_num` tactic to verify the arithmetic.
