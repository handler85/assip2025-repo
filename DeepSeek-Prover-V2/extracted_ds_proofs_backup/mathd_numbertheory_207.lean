### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to evaluate the expression `8 * 9² + 5 * 9 + 2` step by step to show that it equals `695`.

1. **Calculate `9²`**:
   \[ 9^2 = 81 \]

2. **Multiply by `8`**:
   \[ 8 \times 81 = 648 \]

3. **Multiply by `5` and add `2`**:
   \[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \]
   \[ 45 + 2 = 47 \]

4. **Add the results from steps 2 and 3**:
   \[ 648 + 47 = 695 \]

Thus, the final result is `695`, as required.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Compute `9²`**:
   - Calculate `9 * 9` to get `81`.

2. **Multiply by `8`**:
   - Multiply `81` by `8` to get `648`.

3. **Multiply by `5` and add `2`**:
   - Multiply `9` by `5` to get `45`.
   - Add `2` to `45` to get `47`.

4. **Add the results**:
   - Add `648` and `47` to get `695`.

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
  have h₁ : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by sorry
  sorry
```

This `have` statement directly reflects the final result of the calculation, and the proof is trivial once the calculation is done correctly. The `sorry` can be replaced by the detailed calculation steps provided earlier.
