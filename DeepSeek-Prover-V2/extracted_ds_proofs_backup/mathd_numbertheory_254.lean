### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the remainder when the sum `239 + 174 + 83` is divided by `10`. 

1. **Calculate the sum:**
   \[
   239 + 174 + 83 = 239 + 174 = 413 \\
   413 + 83 = 496
   \]
   So, the sum is `496`.

2. **Find the remainder of `496` divided by `10`:**
   The last digit of `496` is `6`, so the remainder is `6`.

Alternatively, we can observe that:
   - The last digit of `239` is `9`.
   - The last digit of `174` is `4`.
   - The last digit of `83` is `3`.
   - The last digit of `9 + 4 = 13` is `3`.
   - The last digit of `3 + 3 = 6` is `6`.
   - Therefore, the last digit of the sum is `6`, and the remainder is `6`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Calculate the sum of the numbers:**
   - `239 + 174 = 413`
   - `413 + 83 = 496`
   - So, `239 + 174 + 83 = 496`.

2. **Find the remainder of `496` divided by `10`:**
   - The last digit of `496` is `6`, so `496 % 10 = 6`.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_254 : (239 + 174 + 83) % 10 = 6 := by
  have h_sum : 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 := by sorry
  have h_mod : 496 % 10 = 6 := by sorry
  have h_final : (239 + 174 + 83) % 10 = 6 := by sorry
  exact h_final
```
