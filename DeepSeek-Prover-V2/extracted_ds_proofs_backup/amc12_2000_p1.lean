### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the problem:
We have three distinct positive integers \( I, M, O \) such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \). We need to find the largest possible value of \( I + M + O \), and show that it is at most 671.

#### Step 1: Factorize 2001
First, factorize 2001:
\[ 2001 = 3 \times 23 \times 29 \]

#### Step 2: Enumerate Possible Triples
Since \( I, M, O \) are distinct positive integers whose product is 2001, each of them must be a divisor of 2001. The possible ordered triples \((I, M, O)\) (up to permutation) are:
1. \((1, 3, 667)\)
2. \((1, 23, 87)\)
3. \((1, 29, 69)\)
4. \((3, 1, 667)\)
5. \((3, 23, 29)\)
6. \((3, 29, 23)\)
7. \((23, 1, 87)\)
8. \((23, 3, 29)\)
9. \((29, 1, 69)\)
10. \((29, 3, 23)\)
11. \((667, 1, 3)\)
12. \((87, 1, 23)\)
13. \((69, 1, 29)\)
14. \((29, 23, 3)\)
15. \((23, 29, 3)\)
16. \((29, 3, 23)\)
17. \((3, 29, 23)\)
18. \((23, 3, 29)\)
19. \((3, 23, 29)\)

However, we can reduce the number of cases by noting that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \) is fixed, and the sum \( I + M + O \) is maximized when the numbers are as large as possible. The largest possible sum is achieved when the numbers are as close to each other as possible, given the product constraint.

But since the numbers must be distinct, the best case is when two numbers are as small as possible and the third is as large as possible. The smallest possible distinct positive integers are \( 1, 2 \), but \( 1 \cdot 2 \cdot O = 2001 \) has no solution since \( O \) would be \( 1000.5 \), which is not an integer. The next smallest are \( 1, 2, 3 \), but \( 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \neq 2001 \). The smallest possible distinct positive integers are \( 1, 2, \ldots \), but the product is too small.

Thus, the correct approach is to consider the largest possible numbers first. The largest possible number is \( 69 \), since \( 69 \times 29 = 2001 \). The next possible number is \( 29 \), but \( 29 \times 69 = 2001 \), and the third number would be \( 1 \), but \( 1 \times 29 \times 69 = 2001 \). This gives the sum \( 1 + 29 + 69 = 99 \).

But wait, we can do better! The next possible number is \( 23 \), since \( 23 \times 87 = 2001 \). The third number is \( 1 \), but \( 1 \times 23 \times 87 = 2001 \), giving the sum \( 1 + 23 + 87 = 111 \).

This is better than \( 99 \), but we can do even better! The next possible number is \( 29 \), but we already considered it. The next possible number is \( 3 \), since \( 3 \times 23 \times 29 = 2001 \). The sum is \( 3 + 23 + 29 = 55 \).

This is worse than \( 111 \). Thus, the maximum sum is \( 111 \).

But wait, we missed some cases! The correct approach is to consider all possible ordered triples \((I, M, O)\) such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \) and \( I, M, O \) are distinct positive integers. The possible ordered triples are:
1. \((1, 3, 667)\)
2. \((1, 23, 87)\)
3. \((1, 29, 69)\)
4. \((3, 1, 667)\)
5. \((3, 23, 29)\)
6. \((3, 29, 23)\)
7. \((23, 1, 87)\)
8. \((23, 3, 29)\)
9. \((29, 1, 69)\)
10. \((29, 3, 23)\)
11. \((667, 1, 3)\)
12. \((87, 1, 23)\)
13. \((69, 1, 29)\)
14. \((29, 23, 3)\)
15. \((23, 29, 3)\)
16. \((29, 3, 23)\)
17. \((3, 29, 23)\)
18. \((23, 3, 29)\)
19. \((3, 23, 29)\)

The corresponding sums are:
1. \( 1 + 3 + 667 = 671 \)
2. \( 1 + 23 + 87 = 111 \)
3. \( 1 + 29 + 69 = 99 \)
4. \( 3 + 1 + 667 = 671 \)
5. \( 3 + 23 + 29 = 55 \)
6. \( 3 + 29 + 23 = 55 \)
7. \( 23 + 1 + 87 = 111 \)
8. \( 23 + 3 + 29 = 55 \)
9. \( 29 + 1 + 69 = 99 \)
10. \( 29 + 3 + 23 = 55 \)
11. \( 667 + 1 + 3 = 671 \)
12. \( 87 + 1 + 23 = 111 \)
13. \( 69 + 1 + 29 = 99 \)
14. \( 29 + 23 + 3 = 55 \)
15. \( 23 + 29 + 3 = 55 \)
16. \( 29 + 3 + 23 = 55 \)
17. \( 3 + 29 + 23 = 55 \)
18. \( 23 + 3 + 29 = 55 \)
19. \( 3 + 23 + 29 = 55 \)

The maximum sum is \( 671 \), achieved by the triples \((1, 3, 667)\), \((1, 667, 3)\), \((3, 1, 667)\), \((3, 667, 1)\), \((667, 1, 3)\), \((667, 3, 1)\).

#### Step 3: Prove the Maximum Sum
To prove that the maximum sum is \( 671 \), we need to show that for any other distinct positive integers \( I, M, O \) such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), the sum \( I + M + O \) is at most \( 671 \).

We can use the AM-GM inequality to bound the sum. The AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers \( a, b, c \), we have:
\[ \frac{a + b + c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc} \]

Applying this to our problem, we have:
\[ \frac{I + M + O}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{I \cdot M \cdot O} = \sqrt[3]{2001} \approx 12.48 \]

Thus:
\[ I + M + O \geq 3 \times 12.48 \approx 37.44 \]

This is a very weak bound, and it does not help us to prove that the maximum sum is \( 671 \).

Instead, we can use the fact that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \) is fixed, and the sum \( I + M + O \) is maximized when the numbers are as large as possible. The largest possible numbers are \( 667, 3, 1 \), which give the sum \( 667 + 3 + 1 = 671 \).

Thus, the maximum sum is \( 671 \), and it is achieved by the triples \((1, 3, 667)\), \((1, 667, 3)\), \((3, 1, 667)\), \((3, 667, 1)\), \((667, 1, 3)\), \((667, 3, 1)\).

### Step 4: Abstract Plan
1. **Factorize 2001**: \( 2001 = 3 \times 23 \times 29 \).
2. **List all ordered triples \((I, M, O)\) of distinct positive integers such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \)**:
   - Enumerate all possible ordered triples by permuting the factors of 2001.
3. **Calculate the sum \( I + M + O \) for each triple**:
   - Compute the sum for each triple and identify the maximum sum.
4. **Prove the maximum sum is 671**:
   - Show that no other distinct positive integer triple \((I, M, O)\) with \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \) gives a larger sum.
