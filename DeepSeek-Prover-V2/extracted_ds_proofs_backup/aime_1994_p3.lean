### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given a recurrence relation for a function `f : ℤ → ℤ`:
\[ f(x) + f(x - 1) = x^2 \quad \text{for all} \quad x \in \mathbb{Z}. \]
We are also given that `f(19) = 94` and must find `f(94) mod 1000`.

#### Step 1: Find a closed-form expression for `f(x)`

The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard methods. First, we find the homogeneous solution:
\[ f(x) + f(x - 1) = 0. \]
This is a first-order recurrence, and its characteristic equation is:
\[ r + 1 = 0 \implies r = -1. \]
Thus, the homogeneous solution is:
\[ f_h(x) = A (-1)^x. \]

Next, we find a particular solution. The nonhomogeneous term is `x²`, so we guess a quadratic form:
\[ f_p(x) = B x^2 + C x + D. \]
Substituting into the recurrence:
\[ f_p(x) + f_p(x - 1) = B x^2 + C x + D + B (x - 1)^2 + C (x - 1) + D. \]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[ B x^2 + C x + D + B (x^2 - 2x + 1) + C x - C + D. \]
\[ = B x^2 + C x + D + B x^2 - 2 B x + B + C x - C + D. \]
\[ = (2 B) x^2 + (2 C) x + (2 D - 2 B - C) + B. \]
For this to equal `x²`, we must have:
\[ 2 B = 1, \quad 2 C = 0, \quad 2 D - 2 B - C = 0, \quad B = 0. \]
This is a contradiction because `2 B = 1` is impossible. Thus, our guess was incorrect, and we must try a different form.

Alternatively, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients to find a particular solution. The nonhomogeneous term is `x²`, and the homogeneous solution is `A (-1)^x`. We can guess a particular solution of the form:
\[ f_p(x) = B x^2 + C x + D + E (-1)^x. \]
However, this is complicated, and we can instead use the fact that the recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients. The general solution is:
\[ f(x) = A (-1)^x + B x^2 + C x + D. \]

But we can also use the method of generating functions. The recurrence is:
\[ f(x) + f(x - 1) = x^2. \]
Multiply both sides by `z^x` and sum over `x ≥ 0`:
\[ \sum_{x \geq 0} f(x) z^x + \sum_{x \geq 0} f(x - 1) z^x = \sum_{x \geq 0} x^2 z^x. \]
The first sum is `F(z)`, the second sum is `z F(z)`, and the right-hand side is `z^2 / (1 - z)^3`:
\[ F(z) + z F(z) = \frac{z^2}{(1 - z)^3}. \]
Thus:
\[ F(z) (1 + z) = \frac{z^2}{(1 - z)^3}. \]
\[ F(z) = \frac{z^2}{(1 - z)^3 (1 + z)}. \]
This can be simplified further, but we can instead use partial fractions to find a closed form.

However, we can also use the recurrence to find `f(94)` directly. We can compute `f(x)` for `x` from `19` to `94` using the recurrence.

#### Step 2: Compute `f(x)` for `x` from `19` to `94`

We are given `f(19) = 94`. Using the recurrence:
\[ f(19) + f(18) = 19^2 = 361. \]
Thus:
\[ f(18) = 361 - 94 = 267. \]
Similarly:
\[ f(17) + f(16) = 17^2 = 289. \]
\[ f(16) = 289 - f(17). \]
But we don't know `f(17)`. We can continue this process until we reach `f(94)`.

However, this is tedious. Instead, we can look for a pattern or a recurrence that relates `f(x)` to `f(x - 1)`.

#### Step 3: Find a recurrence for `f(x)`

From the recurrence:
\[ f(x) + f(x - 1) = x^2. \]
We can write:
\[ f(x) = x^2 - f(x - 1). \]
This is a recurrence that allows us to compute `f(x)` in terms of `f(x - 1)`.

#### Step 4: Compute `f(x)` for `x` from `19` to `94` using the recurrence

We are given `f(19) = 94`. Using the recurrence:
\[ f(20) = 20^2 - f(19) = 400 - 94 = 306. \]
\[ f(21) = 21^2 - f(20) = 441 - 306 = 135. \]
\[ f(22) = 22^2 - f(21) = 484 - 135 = 349. \]
\[ f(23) = 23^2 - f(22) = 529 - 349 = 180. \]
\[ f(24) = 24^2 - f(23) = 576 - 180 = 396. \]
\[ f(25) = 25^2 - f(24) = 625 - 396 = 229. \]
\[ f(26) = 26^2 - f(25) = 676 - 229 = 447. \]

\[ f(82) = 82^2 - f(81) = 6724 - 3225 = 3499. \]
\[ f(83) = 83^2 - f(82) = 6889 - 3499 = 3390. \]
\[ f(84) = 84^2 - f(83) = 7056 - 3390 = 3666. \]

\[ f(88) = 88^2 - f(87) = 7744 - 3732 = 4012. \]
\[ f(89) = 89^2 - f(88) = 7921 - 4012 = 3909. \]
\[ f(90) = 90^2 - f(89) = 8100 - 3909 = 4191. \]
\[ f(91) = 91^2 - f(90) = 8281 - 4191 = 4090. \]
\[ f(92) = 92^2 - f(91) = 8464 - 4090 = 4374. \]
\[ f(93) = 93^2 - f(92) = 8649 - 4374 = 4275. \]
\[ f(94) = 94^2 - f(93) = 8836 - 4275 = 4561. \]

Thus, `f(94) = 4561`.

#### Step 5: Compute `f(94) mod 1000`

We have `f(94) = 4561`. To find `4561 mod 1000`, we subtract the largest multiple of `1000` that is less than or equal to `4561`:
\[ 1000 \times 4 = 4000. \]
Thus:
\[ 4561 - 4000 = 561. \]
Therefore:
\[ f(94) \mod 1000 = 561. \]
