### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem:** Determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6. Show that it is 5.

**Approach:**
To find \( 1529 \mod 6 \), we can perform the division of 1529 by 6 and observe the remainder. Alternatively, we can simplify the problem by reducing the numbers modulo 6 step by step.

1. **Direct Calculation:**
   - \( 1529 \div 6 = 254 \) with a remainder of \( 1529 - 6 \times 254 = 1529 - 1524 = 5 \).
   - Thus, \( 1529 \mod 6 = 5 \).

2. **Alternative Approach:**
   - Break down 1529 into parts that are easier to work with modulo 6.
   - \( 1529 = 1500 + 29 \).
   - \( 1500 \mod 6 \):
     - \( 1500 = 6 \times 250 \), so \( 1500 \mod 6 = 0 \).
   - \( 29 \mod 6 \):
     - \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \), \( 29 - 24 = 5 \), so \( 29 \mod 6 = 5 \).
   - Thus, \( 1529 \mod 6 = (1500 \mod 6) + (29 \mod 6) = 0 + 5 = 5 \).

Both approaches lead to the same conclusion: \( 1529 \mod 6 = 5 \).

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6.

2. **Approach:**
   - Use the division algorithm to find \( 1529 \div 6 \).
   - Alternatively, break down 1529 into parts that are easier to work with modulo 6.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - Calculate \( 1529 \div 6 = 254 \) with a remainder of \( 1529 - 6 \times 254 = 5 \).
   - Alternatively, break down 1529 into 1500 + 29, find \( 1500 \mod 6 = 0 \), and \( 29 \mod 6 = 5 \), so the sum is \( 0 + 5 = 5 \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The remainder is 5.
