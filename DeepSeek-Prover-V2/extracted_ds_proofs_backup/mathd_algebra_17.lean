### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to solve the equation:
\[ \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a}} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + a}} = 6. \]

#### Step 1: Understand the Domain
For the square roots to be real and defined, the expressions inside them must be non-negative:
1. \( 16 + 16a \geq 0 \) ⇒ \( a \geq -1 \).
2. \( 1 + a \geq 0 \) ⇒ \( a \geq -1 \).
3. \( 4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a} \geq 0 \) ⇒ \( \sqrt{16 + 16a} \geq -4 \), which is always true since square roots are non-negative.
4. \( 1 + \sqrt{1 + a} \geq 0 \) ⇒ \( \sqrt{1 + a} \geq -1 \), which is always true.

Thus, the domain is \( a \geq -1 \).

#### Step 2: Guess the Solution
We can try to find a solution by testing simple integer values. Let's try \( a = 8 \):
1. \( 16 + 16 \cdot 8 = 16 + 128 = 144 \).
2. \( \sqrt{144} = 12 \).
3. \( 4 + 12 = 16 \).
4. \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).
5. \( 1 + a = 1 + 8 = 9 \).
6. \( \sqrt{9} = 3 \).
7. \( 1 + 3 = 4 \).
8. \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \).
9. The left-hand side becomes \( 4 + 2 = 6 \), which matches the right-hand side.

Thus, \( a = 8 \) is indeed a solution.

#### Step 3: Prove Uniqueness
We need to show that \( a = 8 \) is the only solution. 

First, observe that the expression inside the first square root is \( 4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a} \). The square root \( \sqrt{16 + 16a} \) is minimized when \( a \) is minimized, i.e., when \( a = -1 \). At \( a = -1 \), \( \sqrt{16 + 16a} = \sqrt{0} = 0 \), so the expression inside the first square root is \( 4 + 0 = 4 \). The first square root is \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \).

Similarly, the expression inside the second square root is \( 1 + \sqrt{1 + a} \). The square root \( \sqrt{1 + a} \) is minimized when \( a \) is minimized, i.e., when \( a = -1 \). At \( a = -1 \), \( \sqrt{1 + a} = \sqrt{0} = 0 \), so the expression inside the second square root is \( 1 + 0 = 1 \). The second square root is \( \sqrt{1} = 1 \).

Thus, the minimum possible value of the left-hand side is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is less than 6. 

To find the maximum possible value of the left-hand side, observe that \( \sqrt{16 + 16a} \) is maximized when \( a \) is maximized, i.e., as \( a \to \infty \). Similarly, \( \sqrt{1 + a} \) is maximized as \( a \to \infty \). Thus, the left-hand side is maximized as \( a \to \infty \), and the limit is \( \infty \).

Therefore, the left-hand side is strictly increasing in \( a \) for \( a \geq -1 \), and the only solution to the equation is \( a = 8 \).

#### Step 4: Verification
We have already verified that \( a = 8 \) is indeed a solution. 

### Step 5: Abstract Plan

1. **Domain Analysis**:
   - Determine the domain of \( a \) by ensuring all square roots are real and non-negative.
   - The domain is \( a \geq -1 \).

2. **Minimum and Maximum Analysis**:
   - Find the minimum possible value of the left-hand side (LHS) to ensure it is less than 6.
   - The minimum LHS is 3, which is less than 6.
   - Find the maximum possible value of the LHS to ensure it is greater than 6.
   - The LHS is strictly increasing in \( a \), so the maximum is \( \infty \).

3. **Uniqueness of Solution**:
   - Since the LHS is strictly increasing and continuous, there is exactly one solution to the equation.
   - The solution is \( a = 8 \).

4. **Verification**:
   - Substitute \( a = 8 \) back into the original equation to confirm it holds.
