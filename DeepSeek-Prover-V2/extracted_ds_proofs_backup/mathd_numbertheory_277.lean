### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two positive integers \( m \) and \( n \):
\[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \cdot \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \cdot n. \]

Given:
1. \(\text{gcd}(m, n) = 6\),
2. \(\text{lcm}(m, n) = 126\),

we can substitute these into the relationship to find \( m \cdot n \):
\[ 6 \cdot 126 = m \cdot n \implies m \cdot n = 756. \]

We are also given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers, and we need to find the smallest possible value of \( m + n \).

#### Approach to Find \( m + n \)

To minimize \( m + n \), we need to find pairs of positive integers \( (m, n) \) such that:
1. \( m \cdot n = 756 \),
2. \( \text{gcd}(m, n) = 6 \),
and then take the smallest possible sum.

#### Factorization of 756

First, factorize 756:
\[ 756 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 7. \]

We need to find pairs \((m, n)\) such that:
1. \( m \cdot n = 756 \),
2. \( \text{gcd}(m, n) = 6 \).

This is equivalent to:
1. \( m \cdot n = 756 \),
2. \( 6 \mid m \) and \( 6 \mid n \),
because if \( \text{gcd}(m, n) = 6 \), then \( 6 \mid m \) and \( 6 \mid n \).

#### Rewriting the Problem

Let \( m = 6a \) and \( n = 6b \), where \( a, b \) are positive integers. Then:
\[ m \cdot n = 6a \cdot 6b = 36ab = 756 \implies ab = \frac{756}{36} = 21. \]

Thus, we need to find all pairs of positive integers \((a, b)\) such that \( ab = 21 \), and then compute \( m + n = 6(a + b) \).

#### Finding All Pairs \((a, b)\) with \( ab = 21 \)

The positive integer factor pairs of 21 are:
1. \( (1, 21) \),
2. \( (3, 7) \),
3. \( (7, 3) \),
4. \( (21, 1) \).

For each pair \((a, b)\), we compute \( m + n = 6(a + b) \):
1. \( (1, 21) \): \( m + n = 6(1 + 21) = 6 \cdot 22 = 132 \),
2. \( (3, 7) \): \( m + n = 6(3 + 7) = 6 \cdot 10 = 60 \),
3. \( (7, 3) \): \( m + n = 6(7 + 3) = 6 \cdot 10 = 60 \),
4. \( (21, 1) \): \( m + n = 6(21 + 1) = 6 \cdot 22 = 132 \).

The smallest possible sum is \( 60 \), achieved when \( (a, b) = (3, 7) \) or \( (7, 3) \).

#### Verification

For \( m = 18 \) and \( n = 42 \):
1. \( \text{gcd}(18, 42) = 6 \),
2. \( \text{lcm}(18, 42) = 126 \),
3. \( m + n = 18 + 42 = 60 \).

Thus, the minimal sum is indeed \( 60 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Given Information**:
   - We are given that \( \text{gcd}(m, n) = 6 \) and \( \text{lcm}(m, n) = 126 \).
   - We need to find the smallest possible value of \( m + n \).

2. **Use the Relationship Between GCD and LCM**:
   - Recall that \( \text{gcd}(m, n) \cdot \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \cdot n \).
   - Substitute the given values to find \( m \cdot n \):
     \[ 6 \cdot 126 = m \cdot n \implies m \cdot n = 756. \]

3. **Express \( m \) and \( n \) in Terms of GCD**:
   - Since \( \text{gcd}(m, n) = 6 \), we can write \( m = 6a \) and \( n = 6b \), where \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \).
   - Substitute into \( m \cdot n = 756 \):
     \[ (6a)(6b) = 36ab = 756 \implies ab = \frac{756}{36} = 21. \]

4. **Find All Pairs \((a, b)\) with \( ab = 21 \) and \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \)**:
   - The factor pairs of 21 are \( (1, 21) \), \( (3, 7) \), \( (7, 3) \), and \( (21, 1) \).
   - For each pair, check if \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \):
     - \( (1, 21) \): \( \text{gcd}(1, 21) = 1 \),
     - \( (3, 7) \): \( \text{gcd}(3, 7) = 1 \),
     - \( (7, 3) \): \( \text{gcd}(7, 3) = 1 \),
     - \( (21, 1) \): \( \text{gcd}(21, 1) = 1 \).
   - All pairs satisfy \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \).

5. **Compute \( m + n \) for Each Valid Pair**:
   - For \( (a, b) = (1, 21) \):
     \[ m = 6 \cdot 1 = 6, \quad n = 6 \cdot 21 = 126, \quad m + n = 6 + 126 = 132. \]
   - For \( (a, b) = (3, 7) \):
     \[ m = 6 \cdot 3 = 18, \quad n = 6 \cdot 7 = 42, \quad m + n = 18 + 42 = 60. \]
   - For \( (a, b) = (7, 3) \):
     \[ m = 6 \cdot 7 = 42, \quad n = 6 \cdot 3 = 18, \quad m + n = 42 + 18 = 60. \]
   - For \( (a, b) = (21, 1) \):
     \[ m = 6 \cdot 21 = 126, \quad n = 6 \cdot 1 = 6, \quad m + n = 126 + 6 = 132. \]

6. **Determine the Minimal Sum**:
   - The smallest possible sum is \( 60 \), achieved when \( (a, b) = (3, 7) \) or \( (7, 3) \).
