### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{50} = 40 \]
and we need to prove that \( x = 2000 \).

#### Step 1: Solve for \( x \)
The equation is a simple linear equation in \( x \). To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( 50 \):
\[ x = 40 \times 50 \]
\[ x = 2000 \]

#### Verification
We can verify the solution by substituting \( x = 2000 \) back into the original equation:
\[ \frac{2000}{50} = 40 \]
\[ 40 = 40 \]
This is true, so the solution is correct.

### Step 2: Abstract Plan

1. **Multiply both sides of the equation by 50** to eliminate the denominator:
   \[ x = 40 \times 50 \]
2. **Simplify the right-hand side** to get the final value of \( x \):
   \[ x = 2000 \]
3. **Verify the solution** by substituting back into the original equation to ensure correctness.

### Step 3: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4
