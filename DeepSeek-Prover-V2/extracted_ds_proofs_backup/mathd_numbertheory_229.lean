### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem:** Find the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, i.e., \(5^{30} \mod 7\).

**Approach:** We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) or simply observe the pattern of powers of 5 modulo 7.

**Step 1: Find the pattern of \(5^n \mod 7\).**

Compute the first few powers of 5 modulo 7:
- \(5^1 \mod 7 = 5\)
- \(5^2 \mod 7 = 25 \mod 7 = 4\)
- \(5^3 \mod 7 = 5 \times 4 = 20 \mod 7 = 6\)
- \(5^4 \mod 7 = 5 \times 6 = 30 \mod 7 = 2\)
- \(5^5 \mod 7 = 5 \times 2 = 10 \mod 7 = 3\)
- \(5^6 \mod 7 = 5 \times 3 = 15 \mod 7 = 1\)
- \(5^7 \mod 7 = 5 \times 1 = 5\)

Observe that the pattern repeats every 6 powers. Specifically, \(5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\).

**Step 2: Simplify \(5^{30} \mod 7\).**

Since \(5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\), we can write:
\[ 5^{30} = (5^6)^5 \equiv 1^5 \equiv 1 \mod 7. \]

Thus, the remainder is \(1\).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find \(5^{30} \mod 7\).

2. **Find the Pattern of Powers of 5 Modulo 7:**
   - Compute \(5^1 \mod 7, 5^2 \mod 7, \ldots\) until a cycle is detected.
   - Observe that \(5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\).

3. **Simplify \(5^{30} \mod 7\):**
   - Express \(5^{30}\) as \((5^6)^5\).
   - Since \(5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\), \((5^6)^5 \equiv 1^5 \equiv 1 \mod 7\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The remainder is \(1\).

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_229 : 5 ^ 30 % 7 = 1 := by
  have h_main : 5 ^ 30 % 7 = 1 := by
    sorry
  sorry
```

This `have` statement directly corresponds to the final result we derived. The `sorry` is a placeholder for the detailed proof, which we have already outlined above.
