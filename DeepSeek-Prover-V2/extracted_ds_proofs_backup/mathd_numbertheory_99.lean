### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to solve the congruence `2n ≡ 15 mod 47` for `n` modulo 47. 

#### Step 1: Understand the Congruence
The congruence `2n ≡ 15 mod 47` means that `2n - 15` is divisible by 47, i.e., `2n - 15 = 47k` for some integer `k`. 

#### Step 2: Solve for `n`
We can rearrange the equation to solve for `n`:
`2n = 15 + 47k`
`n = (15 + 47k)/2`

For `n` to be an integer, `15 + 47k` must be even. Since `15` is odd, `47k` must be odd (because odd + odd = even). But `47` is odd, so `k` must be odd. 

Let `k = 2m + 1` for some integer `m`. Then:
`n = (15 + 47(2m + 1))/2 = (15 + 94m + 47)/2 = (62 + 94m)/2 = 31 + 47m`

Thus, `n ≡ 31 mod 47` is the general solution. 

#### Step 3: Verify the Solution
We can check that `2 * (31 + 47m) ≡ 15 mod 47`:
`2 * (31 + 47m) = 62 + 94m = 62 + 47 * 2m`
`62 mod 47 = 15` because `47 * 1 = 47` and `62 - 47 = 15`.
Thus, `2 * (31 + 47m) ≡ 15 mod 47` is correct.

#### Step 4: Find `n mod 47`
Given that `n = 31 + 47m`, we have `n ≡ 31 mod 47` because `47m ≡ 0 mod 47`.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Congruence**:
   - The given congruence is `2n ≡ 15 mod 47`.
   - This means `2n - 15` is divisible by 47.

2. **Solve for `n`**:
   - Rearrange to `2n = 15 + 47k` for some integer `k`.
   - Solve for `n` to get `n = (15 + 47k)/2`.
   - Since `47` is odd, `k` must be odd to make `15 + 47k` even.
   - Let `k = 2m + 1` and substitute to get `n = 31 + 47m`.

3. **Find `n mod 47`**:
   - Since `47m ≡ 0 mod 47`, we have `n ≡ 31 mod 47`.

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_99 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : 2 * n % 47 = 15) : n % 47 = 31 := by
  have h₁ : n % 47 = 31 := by
    sorry
  sorry
```

This `have` statement directly reflects the final result we derived, and the proof can be completed by filling in the `sorry` with the detailed reasoning from the abstract plan.
