### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given:
1. \( a \cdot b = 180 \)
2. \( 2(a + b) = 54 \)

We need to prove that \( a^2 + b^2 = 369 \).

#### Step 1: Simplify the Perimeter Equation
The second equation is:
\[ 2(a + b) = 54 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ a + b = 27 \]

#### Step 2: Use the Identity for \( a^2 + b^2 \)
We know that:
\[ (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \]
But we can also write:
\[ a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab \]

#### Step 3: Substitute Known Values
From Step 1, \( a + b = 27 \). From the first equation, \( ab = 180 \). Substitute these into the expression for \( a^2 + b^2 \):
\[ a^2 + b^2 = (27)^2 - 2 \cdot 180 = 729 - 360 = 369 \]

This completes the proof.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the Perimeter Equation**:
   - Start with \( 2(a + b) = 54 \).
   - Divide by 2 to get \( a + b = 27 \).

2. **Relate \( a^2 + b^2 \) to \( (a + b)^2 \)**:
   - Use the identity \( a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab \).

3. **Substitute Known Values**:
   - Substitute \( a + b = 27 \) and \( ab = 180 \) into the identity to get \( a^2 + b^2 = 369 \).
