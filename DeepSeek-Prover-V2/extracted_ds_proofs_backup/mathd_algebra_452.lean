### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem. We have a sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` with the following properties:
1. For all `n`, `a(n + 2) - a(n + 1) = a(n + 1) - a(n)`. This means that the second differences of the sequence are zero, i.e., the sequence is **arithmetic**.
2. `a(1) = 2/3`.
3. `a(9) = 4/5`.

We need to find `a(5)` and show that it is `11/15`.

#### Step 1: Recognize the Sequence is Arithmetic
The condition `a(n + 2) - a(n + 1) = a(n + 1) - a(n)` for all `n` is the defining property of an arithmetic sequence. This means that the second differences are zero, and the sequence is linear in `n`.

#### Step 2: General Form of the Arithmetic Sequence
An arithmetic sequence can be written as:
\[ a(n) = a(0) + n \cdot d \]
where `a(0)` is the first term and `d` is the common difference.

However, the problem gives us `a(1)`, not `a(0)`, so we can adjust the form slightly:
\[ a(n) = a(1) + (n - 1) \cdot d \]

But since we know `a(1) = 2/3`, this becomes:
\[ a(n) = \frac{2}{3} + (n - 1) \cdot d \]

#### Step 3: Find the Common Difference `d`
We are given `a(9) = 4/5`. Plugging this into the general form:
\[ a(9) = \frac{2}{3} + (9 - 1) \cdot d = \frac{2}{3} + 8d = \frac{4}{5} \]

Solve for `d`:
\[ 8d = \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ 8d = \frac{12}{15} - \frac{10}{15} \]
\[ 8d = \frac{2}{15} \]
\[ d = \frac{2}{15} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{120} = \frac{1}{60} \]

But wait, this seems incorrect because `8d = 2/15` implies `d = 1/60`, but earlier we had `a(9) = 4/5` and `a(1) = 2/3`, so `a(9) - a(1) = 4/5 - 2/3 = 12/15 - 10/15 = 2/15`. The number of terms from `a(1)` to `a(9)` is `9 - 1 = 8`, so the common difference is `d = (a(9) - a(1)) / 8 = (2/15) / 8 = 1/60`. This is correct.

#### Step 4: Find `a(5)`
Now that we have `d = 1/60`, we can find `a(5)`:
\[ a(5) = a(1) + (5 - 1) \cdot d = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{60} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{60} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{15} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10}{15}, \quad \frac{10}{15} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{11}{15} \]
Thus, `a(5) = 11/15`.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Sequence is Arithmetic**:
   - The condition `a(n + 2) - a(n + 1) = a(n + 1) - a(n)` for all `n` implies the sequence is arithmetic.

2. **Find the Common Difference `d`**:
   - Use the given values `a(1) = 2/3` and `a(9) = 4/5` to find `d = 1/60`.

3. **Find `a(5)`**:
   - Use the arithmetic sequence formula to find `a(5) = 11/15`.

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_algebra_452 (a : ℕ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ n, a (n + 2) - a (n + 1) = a (n + 1) - a n)
    (h₁ : a 1 = 2 / 3) (h₂ : a 9 = 4 / 5) : a 5 = 11 / 15 := by
  have h_common_diff : a 1 + 8 * (a 9 - a 1) / 8 = a 9 := by sorry
  have h_d : a 9 - a 1 = 2 / 15 := by sorry
  have h_d_calc : a 9 - a 1 = 2 / 15 := by sorry
  have h_d_val : (a 9 - a 1) / 8 = 1 / 60 := by sorry
  have h_a5 : a 5 = 11 / 15 := by sorry
  sorry
```

### Explanation of `have` Statements:
1. `h_common_diff`: This is a placeholder for the arithmetic sequence property that the common difference can be expressed in terms of the first and last terms.
2. `h_d`: This is a placeholder for the calculation that `a 9 - a 1 = 2 / 15`.
3. `h_d_calc`: This is a placeholder for the same calculation.
4. `h_d_val`: This is a placeholder for the calculation that `(a 9 - a 1) / 8 = 1 / 60`.
5. `h_a5`: This is a placeholder for the final calculation that `a 5 = 11 / 15`.

Each `have` statement is followed by `sorry`, indicating that the proof is incomplete. The actual proof would fill in these gaps with the appropriate Lean 4 tactics and calculations.
