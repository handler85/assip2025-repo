### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given a natural number `n` such that when `n` is divided by `5`, the remainder is `3`. We need to prove that when `2 * n` is divided by `5`, the remainder is `1`.

**Key Observations:**
1. The condition `n % 5 = 3` can be rewritten as `n = 5 * k + 3` for some integer `k ≥ 0`.
2. Multiplying both sides by `2` gives `2 * n = 2 * (5 * k + 3) = 10 * k + 6`.
3. We can simplify `10 * k + 6` modulo `5` as follows:
   - `10 * k ≡ 0 mod 5` because `10 ≡ 0 mod 5`.
   - `6 ≡ 1 mod 5` because `5 * 1 = 5` and `6 - 5 = 1`.
   - Therefore, `10 * k + 6 ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 5`.

**Proof Sketch:**
1. From `n % 5 = 3`, we have `n = 5 * k + 3` for some `k ∈ ℕ`.
2. Multiply both sides by `2` to get `2 * n = 10 * k + 6`.
3. Compute `(10 * k + 6) % 5` as follows:
   - `10 * k % 5 = 0` because `10 % 5 = 0`.
   - `6 % 5 = 1`.
   - Therefore, `(10 * k + 6) % 5 = 1`.
4. Hence, `2 * n % 5 = 1`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Given Condition**:
   - `n % 5 = 3` means that `n` leaves a remainder of `3` when divided by `5`.

2. **Understand the Goal**:
   - We need to find `2 * n % 5` and show that it is `1`.

3. **Derive the Relationship**:
   - Since `n % 5 = 3`, we can write `n = 5 * k + 3` for some integer `k ≥ 0`.
   - Multiply both sides by `2` to get `2 * n = 10 * k + 6`.

4. **Compute the Remainder**:
   - Compute `(10 * k + 6) % 5`:
     - `10 * k % 5 = 0` because `10 % 5 = 0`.
     - `6 % 5 = 1`.
     - Therefore, `(10 * k + 6) % 5 = 1`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `2 * n = 10 * k + 6` and `(10 * k + 6) % 5 = 1`, we have `2 * n % 5 = 1`.
