### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to prove that for any positive integer \( n \),
\[
\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}.
\]

#### Observations:
1. The product is increasing in \( n \), since each term \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \) is greater than 1.
2. The right-hand side \( 3 - \frac{1}{n} \) is decreasing in \( n \).
3. For \( n = 1 \), the product is \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), and the RHS is \( 3 - 1 = 2 \). The inequality holds with equality.
4. For \( n = 2 \), the product is \( (1 + 1)(1 + \frac{1}{8}) = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{8} = \frac{18}{8} = \frac{9}{4} = 2.25 \), and the RHS is \( 3 - \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 \). The inequality holds.
5. For \( n \geq 1 \), the product is maximized when \( n = 1 \), and the RHS is minimized when \( n = 1 \).

#### Proof Sketch:
We will use induction on \( n \). The base case \( n = 1 \) is already verified. For the inductive step, assume the inequality holds for some \( n \geq 1 \), i.e.,
\[
\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}.
\]
We need to show that
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) \cdot \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]
By the inductive hypothesis, it suffices to show that:
\[
\left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) \cdot \left(3 - \frac{1}{n}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]
This can be verified by expanding and simplifying both sides. The left-hand side becomes:
\[
3 - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{3}{(n+1)^3} - \frac{1}{n(n+1)^3}.
\]
The right-hand side is:
\[
3 - \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]
Subtracting \( 3 \) from both sides gives:
\[
- \frac{1}{n} + \frac{3}{(n+1)^3} - \frac{1}{n(n+1)^3} \leq - \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]
Multiply both sides by \( n(n+1)^3 \) (which is positive):
\[
- n(n+1)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{n} + n(n+1)^3 \cdot \frac{3}{(n+1)^3} - n(n+1)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{n(n+1)^3} \leq - n(n+1)^3 \cdot \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
- (n+1)^3 + 3n(n+1) - 1 \leq - n(n+1)^2.
\]
This can be further simplified to:
\[
- n^3 - 3n^2 - 3n - 1 + 3n^2 + 3n - 1 \leq - n^3 - 2n^2 - n,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
- n^3 - 2 \leq - n^3 - 2n^2 - n.
\]
This is equivalent to:
\[
- 2 \leq - 2n^2 - n.
\]
This is true for all \( n \geq 1 \), since \( -2n^2 - n \leq -2 \) for \( n \geq 1 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Base Case (\( n = 1 \))**:
   - Compute the product for \( n = 1 \): \( 1 + \frac{1}{1^3} = 2 \).
   - Compute the RHS for \( n = 1 \): \( 3 - \frac{1}{1} = 2 \).
   - The inequality holds with equality.

2. **Inductive Step**:
   - Assume the inequality holds for some \( n \geq 1 \), i.e.,
     \[
     \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}.
     \]
   - Show that the inequality holds for \( n + 1 \), i.e.,
     \[
     \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n+1}.
     \]
   - This involves multiplying both sides of the inductive hypothesis by \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) \) and simplifying to show that the resulting expression is \( \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n+1} \).
