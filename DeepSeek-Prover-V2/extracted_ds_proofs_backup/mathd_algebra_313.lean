### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given complex numbers \( v, i, z \) with the following relationships:
1. \( v = i \cdot z \)
2. \( v = 1 + i \)
3. \( z = 2 - i \)

We need to find \( i \) and show that it is \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).

**Approach:**
1. Substitute \( v = 1 + i \) and \( z = 2 - i \) into the equation \( v = i \cdot z \).
2. Solve for \( i \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.
3. Simplify the resulting expression to match the given form.

**Detailed Solution:**

1. Substitute \( v = 1 + i \) and \( z = 2 - i \) into \( v = i \cdot z \):
   \[
   1 + i = i \cdot (2 - i)
   \]

2. Expand the right-hand side:
   \[
   i \cdot (2 - i) = 2i - i^2
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:
   \[
   2i - i^2 = 2i - (-1) = 2i + 1
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   1 + i = 2i + 1
   \]

3. Subtract \( 1 \) from both sides:
   \[
   i = 2i
   \]

4. Subtract \( 2i \) from both sides:
   \[
   -i = 0
   \]
   This implies \( i = 0 \). However, if we substitute \( i = 0 \) back into the original equation \( v = i \cdot z \), we get \( v = 0 \), but \( v = 1 + i \) implies \( v = 1 \), which is a contradiction. 

   **Wait a minute!** There is a mistake in the above steps. The error is in step 2:
   \[
   i \cdot (2 - i) = 2i - i^2 = 2i - (-1) = 2i + 1
   \]
   is correct, but in step 3, we have:
   \[
   1 + i = 2i + 1
   \]
   Subtracting \( 1 \) from both sides gives:
   \[
   i = 2i
   \]
   Subtracting \( 2i \) from both sides gives:
   \[
   -i = 0
   \]
   which implies \( i = 0 \). 

   But if \( i = 0 \), then \( v = i \cdot z = 0 \), but \( v = 1 + i = 1 \), which is a contradiction. 

   **This means the original problem statement is inconsistent!** 

   But wait, the problem statement is:
   \[
   v = i \cdot z, \quad v = 1 + i, \quad z = 2 - i
   \]
   and we are to find \( i \). 

   Substituting \( v = 1 + i \) and \( z = 2 - i \) into \( v = i \cdot z \) gives:
   \[
   1 + i = i \cdot (2 - i) = 2i - i^2 = 2i - (-1) = 2i + 1
   \]
   Subtracting \( 1 \) from both sides:
   \[
   i = 2i
   \]
   Subtracting \( 2i \) from both sides:
   \[
   -i = 0
   \]
   which implies \( i = 0 \). 

   But if \( i = 0 \), then \( v = i \cdot z = 0 \), but \( v = 1 + i = 1 \), which is a contradiction. 

   **Therefore, the original problem statement is inconsistent!**
