### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We have:
\[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ x + 0.04x = 598 \]
or equivalently:
\[ 1.04x = 598 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by \( 1.04 \):
\[ x = \frac{598}{1.04} \]

But first, let's perform the division more carefully. Note that:
\[ 1.04 = \frac{104}{100} = \frac{26}{25} \]
Thus:
\[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{25}{26} = \frac{598 \cdot 25}{26} \]

Now, let's compute \( 598 \cdot 25 \):
\[ 598 \cdot 25 = 598 \cdot (20 + 5) = 598 \cdot 20 + 598 \cdot 5 = 11960 + 2990 = 14950 \]
Thus:
\[ x = \frac{14950}{26} = 575 \]

But wait, we can also verify this by plugging \( x = 575 \) back into the original equation:
\[ 575 + \frac{4}{100} \cdot 575 = 575 + 23 = 598 \]
This is correct.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the Equation**:
   - The given equation is \( x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \).
   - Factor out \( x \): \( x \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) = 598 \).
   - Simplify the coefficient: \( 1 + \frac{4}{100} = \frac{104}{100} = \frac{26}{25} \).
   - The equation becomes \( x \cdot \frac{26}{25} = 598 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by \( \frac{25}{26} \): \( x = 598 \cdot \frac{25}{26} \).
   - Compute \( 598 \cdot 25 = 14950 \).
   - Compute \( \frac{14950}{26} = 575 \).

3. **Verification**:
   - Plug \( x = 575 \) back into the original equation to ensure correctness.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_algebra_137 (x : ℕ) (h₀ : ↑x + (4 : ℝ) / (100 : ℝ) * ↑x = 598) : x = 575 := by
  have h₁ : (x : ℝ) * (26 / 25 : ℝ) = 598 := by sorry
  have h₂ : x = 575 := by sorry
  sorry
```

### Explanation:
1. `h₁`: We first rewrite the original equation to isolate the term involving `x` and simplify the coefficient to `26/25`.
2. `h₂`: We solve for `x` by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of `26/25` and simplify to get `x = 575`.
