### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the remainder when \(5^{999999}\) is divided by 7. That is, we want to compute \(5^{999999} \mod 7\).

#### Step 1: Find the cycle of \(5^n \mod 7\)
We can observe the pattern of \(5^n \mod 7\) for small \(n\):
- \(5^1 \mod 7 = 5\)
- \(5^2 \mod 7 = 25 \mod 7 = 4\)
- \(5^3 \mod 7 = 5 \times 4 = 20 \mod 7 = 6\)
- \(5^4 \mod 7 = 5 \times 6 = 30 \mod 7 = 2\)
- \(5^5 \mod 7 = 5 \times 2 = 10 \mod 7 = 3\)
- \(5^6 \mod 7 = 5 \times 3 = 15 \mod 7 = 1\)
- \(5^7 \mod 7 = 5 \times 1 = 5\)

We notice that the sequence \(5^n \mod 7\) is periodic with a period of 6. That is, \(5^{n+6} \equiv 5^n \mod 7\) for all \(n \geq 0\).

#### Step 2: Simplify \(5^{999999} \mod 7\)
Since the cycle length is 6, we can reduce the exponent modulo 6:
\[ 999999 \mod 6 = 3 \]
This is because \(6 \times 166666 = 999996\) and \(999999 - 999996 = 3\).

Thus, \(5^{999999} \equiv 5^{3} \mod 7\).

#### Step 3: Compute \(5^3 \mod 7\)
We already know from the earlier calculation that:
\[ 5^3 \mod 7 = 125 \mod 7 = 6 \]

Therefore, the remainder is 6.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find \(5^{999999} \mod 7\).
2. **Find the Cycle of \(5^n \mod 7\)**:
   - Compute \(5^n \mod 7\) for small \(n\) to identify the cycle.
   - The cycle is 6, i.e., \(5^{n+6} \equiv 5^n \mod 7\).
3. **Simplify the Exponent**:
   - Reduce \(999999 \mod 6\) to get \(3\).
4. **Compute the Remainder**:
   - \(5^3 \mod 7 = 6\).
