### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find all real numbers `x` such that `|2 - x| = 3` and then sum them up. The equation `|2 - x| = 3` is equivalent to two cases:
1. `2 - x = 3` ⇒ `x = -1`
2. `2 - x = -3` ⇒ `x = 5`

Thus, the set `S` of solutions is `S = {-1, 5}`. The sum of all elements in `S` is `-1 + 5 = 4`.

#### Verification:
1. For `x = -1`: `|2 - (-1)| = |3| = 3` ✔️
2. For `x = 5`: `|2 - 5| = |-3| = 3` ✔️
3. No other `x` satisfies the equation.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Find the Solutions**:
   - Solve `2 - x = 3` to get `x = -1`.
   - Solve `2 - x = -3` to get `x = 5`.

2. **Verify No Other Solutions**:
   - The absolute value equation `|2 - x| = 3` has no other real solutions.

3. **Construct the Set `S`**:
   - `S = {-1, 5}`.

4. **Sum the Elements of `S`**:
   - `-1 + 5 = 4`.

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_algebra_196 (S : Finset ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x : ℝ, x ∈ S ↔ abs (2 - x) = 3) :
    (∑ k in S, k) = 4 := by
  have h₁ : S = { -1, 5 } := by
    sorry
  have h₂ : (∑ k in S, k) = 4 := by
    sorry
  exact h₂
```

### Explanation:
1. `h₁`: We first prove that `S` is exactly `{ -1, 5 }` by showing that these are the only real numbers satisfying `|2 - x| = 3`.
2. `h₂`: Using `h₁`, we compute the sum of the elements in `S` to be `4`.
