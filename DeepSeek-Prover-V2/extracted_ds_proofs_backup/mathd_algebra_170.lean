### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem correctly. The set `S` is defined as all integers `n` such that `|n - 2| ≤ 5 + 6/10 = 5.6`. 

But Lean represents `5.6` as `5 + 6 / 10`, which is `5 + 0 = 5` because `6 / 10` is integer division. So `5 + 6 / 10 = 5 + 0 = 5`. 

Thus, the condition simplifies to `|n - 2| ≤ 5`, i.e., `-5 ≤ n - 2 ≤ 5`, or equivalently `-3 ≤ n ≤ 7`. 

The integers in this range are `-3, -2, ..., 7`, which are `11` integers. 

But wait, let's verify the Lean condition carefully. 

The Lean condition is `abs (n - 2) ≤ 5 + 6 / 10`, where `5 + 6 / 10` is `5 + 0 = 5` because `6 / 10 = 0` in integer division. 

Thus, the condition is `abs (n - 2) ≤ 5`, i.e., `-5 ≤ n - 2 ≤ 5`, i.e., `-3 ≤ n ≤ 7`. 

The integers in this range are `-3, -2, ..., 7`, which are `11` integers. 

Therefore, the cardinality of `S` is `11`. 

### Step 1: Understand the Condition

The condition for `n` to be in `S` is `|n - 2| ≤ 5 + 6 / 10`. 

First, evaluate `5 + 6 / 10` in Lean:
- `6 / 10` is `0` because it's integer division.
- So `5 + 6 / 10 = 5 + 0 = 5`.

Thus, the condition is `|n - 2| ≤ 5`, i.e., `-5 ≤ n - 2 ≤ 5`, i.e., `-3 ≤ n ≤ 7`.

### Step 2: Find the Integers in the Range

The integers `n` satisfying `-3 ≤ n ≤ 7` are:
`-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`.

There are `11` such integers.

### Step 3: Prove the Cardinality is 11

The set `S` is exactly the set of integers `n` such that `-3 ≤ n ≤ 7`. 

The cardinality of this set is `(7 - (-3) + 1) = 11`. 

Alternatively, we can list all the elements and count them.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Condition**:
   - Simplify `5 + 6 / 10` to `5` because `6 / 10 = 0` in integer division.
   - The condition becomes `|n - 2| ≤ 5`, i.e., `-3 ≤ n ≤ 7`.

2. **Find the Integers in the Range**:
   - List all integers from `-3` to `7`.

3. **Count the Integers**:
   - There are `11` integers in the range `-3` to `7`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The cardinality of `S` is `11`.

### Lean 4 Proof Sketch with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_algebra_170 (S : Finset ℤ) (h₀ : ∀ n : ℤ, n ∈ S ↔ abs (n - 2) ≤ 5 + 6 / 10) :
    S.card = 11 := by
  have h₁ : S = { -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 } := by
    sorry
  have h₂ : S.card = 11 := by
    sorry
  exact h₂
```

### Explanation

1. **`h₁`**: We claim that `S` is exactly the set `{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }`. This is justified by the condition `abs (n - 2) ≤ 5 + 6 / 10` simplifying to `-3 ≤ n ≤ 7` and the fact that all integers in this range satisfy the condition.

2. **`h₂`**: We claim that the cardinality of `S` is `11`. This follows directly from `h₁` because the set `{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }` has `11` elements.

The `sorry` placeholders can be replaced with detailed proofs, but the structure is now clear.
