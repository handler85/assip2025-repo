### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We need to find the remainder when the sum \((n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)\) is divided by 9, given that \(n\) is a positive integer and \(3 \mid n\). 

First, simplify the sum:
\[
(n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18.
\]
Thus, the problem reduces to finding the remainder when \(3n + 18\) is divided by 9.

Since \(3 \mid n\), we can write \(n = 3k\) for some integer \(k \geq 1\) (because \(n > 0\)). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
3n + 18 = 3(3k) + 18 = 9k + 18.
\]
Now, we need to find \((9k + 18) \mod 9\). 

Notice that \(9k \equiv 0 \mod 9\) and \(18 \equiv 0 \mod 9\), so:
\[
9k + 18 \equiv 0 + 0 \equiv 0 \mod 9.
\]
Thus, the remainder is 0.

**Alternative Approach:**
Alternatively, we can directly compute the sum modulo 9:
\[
(n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18.
\]
Since \(3 \mid n\), we have \(9 \mid 3n\) (because \(3n = 3 \cdot 3k = 9k\)). Thus:
\[
3n + 18 \equiv 0 + 0 \equiv 0 \mod 9.
\]

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the Sum**:
   - Combine the terms \((n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)\) to get \(3n + 18\).

2. **Use Divisibility Condition**:
   - Since \(3 \mid n\), write \(n = 3k\) for some integer \(k \geq 1\).
   - Substitute to get \(3n + 18 = 9k + 18\).

3. **Find Remainder Modulo 9**:
   - Observe that \(9k + 18 \equiv 0 + 0 \equiv 0 \mod 9\).
