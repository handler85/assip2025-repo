### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem correctly. We have a sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` with the following properties:
1. For all `m : ℕ`, the difference between consecutive terms is the same as the difference between the next two consecutive terms:
   \[ a(m + 1) - a(m) = a(m + 2) - a(m + 1). \]
   This is equivalent to saying that the second differences are zero, i.e., the sequence is **arithmetic**.
2. The first three terms are given explicitly:
   - `a(1) = 2x - 3`,
   - `a(2) = 5x - 11`,
   - `a(3) = 3x + 1`.
3. The `n`-th term is `a(n) = 2009`, and we need to find `n`.

#### Step 1: Find the common difference `d`

Since the sequence is arithmetic, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let `d` be this common difference. Then:
\[ a(2) - a(1) = d \implies (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = d \implies 3x - 8 = d. \]
Similarly:
\[ a(3) - a(2) = d \implies (3x + 1) - (5x - 11) = d \implies -2x + 12 = d. \]
Equating the two expressions for `d`:
\[ 3x - 8 = -2x + 12 \implies 5x = 20 \implies x = 4. \]
Thus, the common difference is:
\[ d = 3x - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4. \]

#### Step 2: Find the general form of `a(n)`

The general form of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a(n) = a(1) + (n - 1) \cdot d. \]
Given `a(1) = 2x - 3 = 5` and `d = 4`, we have:
\[ a(n) = 5 + (n - 1) \cdot 4 = 5 + 4n - 4 = 4n + 1. \]
But wait, this contradicts the given `a(1) = 2x - 3` and `x = 4`, which would give `a(1) = 5`, not `5`.

But earlier, we derived `x = 4` and `d = 4`, and then `a(1) = 2x - 3 = 5`, so the general form is:
\[ a(n) = 5 + (n - 1) \cdot 4 = 4n + 1. \]

But this contradicts the given `a(3) = 3x + 1 = 13` when `x = 4`, because `a(3) = 5 + 2 * 4 = 13` is correct.

But wait, the general form is `a(n) = 4n + 1`, and `a(3) = 13` is correct.

But the problem gives `a(3) = 3x + 1 = 13` when `x = 4`, which is correct.

But the general form is `a(n) = 4n + 1`, and `a(1) = 5`, `a(2) = 9`, `a(3) = 13`, etc.

But the problem gives `a(1) = 2x - 3 = 5`, `a(2) = 5x - 11 = 9`, `a(3) = 3x + 1 = 13`, etc.

Thus, the general form is correct.

#### Step 3: Find `n` such that `a(n) = 2009`

Given `a(n) = 4n + 1 = 2009`, we solve for `n`:
\[ 4n = 2008 \implies n = \frac{2008}{4} = 502. \]
Thus, `n = 502`.

### Step 4: Verification

We can verify that `a(502) = 2009` using the general form:
\[ a(502) = 4 \cdot 502 + 1 = 2008 + 1 = 2009. \]
This confirms that `n = 502` is the correct solution.

### Step 5: Abstract Plan

1. **Find the common difference `d`**:
   - Use the given terms to find `d` by equating the differences between consecutive terms.
   - Solve for `x` and then `d`.

2. **Find the general form of `a(n)`**:
   - Use the first term and the common difference to write the general form.

3. **Find `n` such that `a(n) = 2009`**:
   - Substitute `a(n) = 2009` into the general form and solve for `n`.

4. **Verify the solution**:
   - Check that the found `n` satisfies the original condition.
