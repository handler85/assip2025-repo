### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given:
1. For all real numbers `t`, `f(t) = t⁴` and `g(t) = 5t² - 6`.
2. `f(x) = g(x)` and `f(y) = g(y)`.
3. `x² < y²`.
4. We need to prove that `y² - x² = 1`.

#### Step 1: Rewrite the Equations
From `f(x) = g(x)`, we have:
`x⁴ = 5x² - 6`.

Similarly, from `f(y) = g(y)`, we have:
`y⁴ = 5y² - 6`.

#### Step 2: Solve `x⁴ = 5x² - 6`
Let `u = x²`. The equation becomes:
`u² = 5u - 6` or `u² - 5u + 6 = 0`.

The roots of `u² - 5u + 6 = 0` are:
`u = (5 ± sqrt(25 - 24))/2 = (5 ± 1)/2`, i.e., `u = 3` or `u = 2`.

Thus, `x² = 3` or `x² = 2`.

#### Step 3: Solve `y⁴ = 5y² - 6`
Let `v = y²`. The equation becomes:
`v² = 5v - 6` or `v² - 5v + 6 = 0`.

The roots of `v² - 5v + 6 = 0` are:
`v = (5 ± sqrt(25 - 24))/2 = (5 ± 1)/2`, i.e., `v = 3` or `v = 2`.

Thus, `y² = 3` or `y² = 2`.

#### Step 4: Analyze `x² < y²`
We have four possible cases for `(x², y²)`:
1. `x² = 2` and `y² = 3`.
2. `x² = 2` and `y² = 2` (but `x² < y²` is false).
3. `x² = 3` and `y² = 2` (but `x² < y²` is false).
4. `x² = 3` and `y² = 3` (but `x² < y²` is false).

The only valid case is `x² = 2` and `y² = 3`, because:
- `x² = 2` and `y² = 2` is invalid (`x² < y²` is false).
- `x² = 3` and `y² = 2` is invalid (`x² < y²` is false).
- `x² = 3` and `y² = 3` is invalid (`x² < y²` is false).

Thus, `x² = 2` and `y² = 3`, and `y² - x² = 1`.

#### Step 5: Verification
We can verify that `x² = 2` and `y² = 3` are the only solutions:
1. For `x² = 2`, `x = ± sqrt(2)`, and `x⁴ = (x²)² = 4`.
   - `5x² - 6 = 5*2 - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 = x⁴`.
2. For `y² = 3`, `y = ± sqrt(3)`, and `y⁴ = (y²)² = 9`.
   - `5y² - 6 = 5*3 - 6 = 15 - 6 = 9 = y⁴`.

Thus, the only solutions are `x² = 2` and `y² = 3`, and `y² - x² = 1`.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Substitute the given functions into the equations**:
   - `x⁴ = 5x² - 6` and `y⁴ = 5y² - 6`.

2. **Find all possible values for `x²` and `y²`**:
   - Solve `u² = 5u - 6` to get `u = 2` or `u = 3`.
   - Thus, `x² = 2` or `x² = 3`, and similarly for `y²`.

3. **Use the condition `x² < y²` to narrow down the possibilities**:
   - The only valid pair is `x² = 2` and `y² = 3`.

4. **Verify the solution**:
   - Check that `x² = 2` and `y² = 3` satisfy all conditions.

5. **Calculate the result**:
   - `y² - x² = 3 - 2 = 1`.
