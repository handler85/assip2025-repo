### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to solve for `a` and `b` using the given equations:
1. `2^a = 32`
2. `a^b = 125`

#### Step 1: Solve for `a` in `2^a = 32`
We know that `32 = 2^5`, so:
`2^a = 2^5`
Since the bases are the same and greater than 1, the exponents must be equal:
`a = 5`

#### Step 2: Solve for `b` in `a^b = 125` with `a = 5`
Substitute `a = 5` into the equation:
`5^b = 125`
We know that `125 = 5^3`, so:
`5^b = 5^3`
Again, since the bases are the same and greater than 1, the exponents must be equal:
`b = 3`

#### Step 3: Compute `b^a` with `b = 3` and `a = 5`
Substitute `b = 3` and `a = 5` into `b^a`:
`3^5 = 243`

### Step 4: Verification
We can verify the solution by checking the original equations:
1. `2^5 = 32` ✔️
2. `5^3 = 125` ✔️
3. `3^5 = 243` ✔️

### Step 5: Abstract Plan
1. **Find `a` from `2^a = 32`**:
   - `32 = 2^5`, so `a = 5`.

2. **Find `b` from `a^b = 125` with `a = 5`**:
   - `125 = 5^3`, so `b = 3`.

3. **Compute `b^a`**:
   - `3^5 = 243`.
