### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given a function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 2} \) for all \( x \neq -2 \). We need to compute \( f(f(1)) \) and show that it equals \( \frac{3}{7} \).

**Step 1: Compute \( f(1) \).**
First, we need to ensure that \( 1 \neq -2 \), which is trivially true. Therefore, we can use the given formula for \( f(1) \):
\[ f(1) = \frac{1}{1 + 2} = \frac{1}{3}. \]

**Step 2: Compute \( f(f(1)) = f\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \).**
Next, we need to ensure that \( \frac{1}{3} \neq -2 \), which is also trivially true. Therefore, we can use the given formula for \( f\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \):
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3} + 2} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{6}{3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{7}{3}} = \frac{3}{7}. \]

Thus, we have shown that \( f(f(1)) = \frac{3}{7} \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Compute \( f(1) \):**
   - Since \( 1 \neq -2 \), use the formula \( f(1) = \frac{1}{1 + 2} = \frac{1}{3} \).

2. **Compute \( f(f(1)) = f\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \):**
   - Since \( \frac{1}{3} \neq -2 \), use the formula \( f\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3} + 2} = \frac{3}{7} \).
