### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given two equations:
1. \( m \cdot 7 + b = -1 \)
2. \( m \cdot (-1) + b = 7 \)

We need to prove that \( m + b = 5 \).

**Approach:**
First, simplify the given equations to eliminate \( b \). Then, solve for \( m \) and substitute back to find \( b \). Finally, compute \( m + b \).

**Step 1: Simplify the Equations**

1. \( 7m + b = -1 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( -m + b = 7 \)  (Equation 2)

**Step 2: Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1**

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[ (7m + b) - (-m + b) = -1 - 7 \]
Simplify:
\[ 7m + b + m - b = -8 \]
\[ 8m = -8 \]
\[ m = -1 \]

**Step 3: Substitute \( m = -1 \) Back into Equation 2**

From Equation 2:
\[ -m + b = 7 \]
Substitute \( m = -1 \):
\[ -(-1) + b = 7 \]
\[ 1 + b = 7 \]
\[ b = 6 \]

**Step 4: Compute \( m + b \)**

\[ m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \]

Thus, \( m + b = 5 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the Given Equations**:
   - We have two equations: \( 7m + b = -1 \) and \( -m + b = 7 \).

2. **Eliminate \( b \)**:
   - Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( b \).

3. **Solve for \( m \)**:
   - The subtraction yields \( 8m = -8 \), so \( m = -1 \).

4. **Find \( b \)**:
   - Substitute \( m = -1 \) back into the second equation to get \( b = 6 \).

5. **Compute \( m + b \)**:
   - The sum is \( m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \).
