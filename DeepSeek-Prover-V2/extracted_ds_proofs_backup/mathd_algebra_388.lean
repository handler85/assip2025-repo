### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have a system of two linear equations in three variables:
1. \( 3x + 4y - 12z = 10 \)
2. \( -2x - 3y + 9z = -4 \)

We need to find the value of \( x \). The expected solution is \( x = 14 \).

**Approach:**
To find \( x \), we can eliminate one of the variables and solve for the remaining one. Here, we can eliminate \( z \) by multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second by 4, and then adding the two equations together.

**Step 1: Eliminate \( z \)**
Multiply the first equation by 3:
\[ 9x + 12y - 36z = 30 \]

Multiply the second equation by 4:
\[ -8x - 12y + 36z = -16 \]

Add these two equations:
\[ (9x + 12y - 36z) + (-8x - 12y + 36z) = 30 + (-16) \]
\[ (9x - 8x) + (12y - 12y) + (-36z + 36z) = 14 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, we have \( x = 14 \).

**Verification:**
Substitute \( x = 14 \) back into the original equations to verify:
1. \( 3(14) + 4y - 12z = 10 \) → \( 42 + 4y - 12z = 10 \) → \( 4y - 12z = -32 \)
2. \( -2(14) - 3y + 9z = -4 \) → \( -28 - 3y + 9z = -4 \) → \( -3y + 9z = 24 \)

Now, solve the two simplified equations:
1. \( 4y - 12z = -32 \)
2. \( -3y + 9z = 24 \)

Divide the second equation by 3:
\[ -y + 3z = 8 \]

Now, we have:
1. \( 4y - 12z = -32 \)
2. \( -y + 3z = 8 \)

Multiply the second equation by 4:
\[ -4y + 12z = 32 \]

Add this to the first equation:
\[ (4y - 12z) + (-4y + 12z) = -32 + 32 \]
\[ 0 = 0 \]

This is an identity, so the system is consistent. We can choose any value for \( z \) to find \( y \). For simplicity, let \( z = 0 \):
From \( -y + 3z = 8 \), we get \( -y = 8 \), so \( y = -8 \).

Check in the first equation:
\[ 4y - 12z = 4(-8) - 12(0) = -32 \]
This matches.

Thus, the solution is consistent, and \( x = 14 \) is correct.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Eliminate \( z \)**:
   - Multiply the first equation by 3.
   - Multiply the second equation by 4.
   - Add the two resulting equations to eliminate \( z \).

2. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - The sum of the two equations directly gives \( x = 14 \).

3. **Verification**:
   - Substitute \( x = 14 \) back into the original equations to find \( y \) and \( z \).
   - Check that the values satisfy both original equations.
