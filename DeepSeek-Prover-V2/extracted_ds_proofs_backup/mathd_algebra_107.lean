### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem. We have a circle with the equation:
\[ x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \]
We need to show that this circle can be rewritten in the standard form of a circle:
\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \]
and that its radius \( r \) is 5.

#### Step 1: Complete the Square for \( x \) and \( y \)

The given equation is:
\[ x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \]

We can complete the square for \( x \) and \( y \) separately.

1. For \( x \):
   \[ x^2 + 8x = (x^2 + 8x + 16) - 16 = (x + 4)^2 - 16 \]

2. For \( y \):
   \[ y^2 - 6y = (y^2 - 6y + 9) - 9 = (y - 3)^2 - 9 \]

#### Step 2: Substitute Back into the Original Equation

Substitute the completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ (x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 25 = 0 \]
Add 25 to both sides:
\[ (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25 \]

#### Step 3: Compare with the Standard Form

The standard form of a circle is:
\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \]
Here, \( h = -4 \), \( k = 3 \), and \( r^2 = 25 \), so \( r = 5 \).

Thus, the radius of the circle is 5.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Complete the Square for \( x \)**:
   - Rewrite \( x^2 + 8x \) as \( (x + 4)^2 - 16 \).

2. **Complete the Square for \( y \)**:
   - Rewrite \( y^2 - 6y \) as \( (y - 3)^2 - 9 \).

3. **Substitute Back and Simplify**:
   - Substitute the completed squares into the original equation and simplify to get \( (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25 \).

4. **Compare with the Standard Form**:
   - Recognize that \( 25 = 5^2 \) and match the form to find the radius \( r = 5 \).
