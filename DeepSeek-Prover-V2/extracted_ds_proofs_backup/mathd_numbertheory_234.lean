### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
- We have a two-digit number `AB` where `A` is the tens digit (1 ≤ A ≤ 9) and `B` is the units digit (0 ≤ B ≤ 9).
- The number `AB` is represented as `10 * A + B` in Lean.
- The cube of `AB` is `912673`, i.e., `(10 * A + B)³ = 912673`.
- We need to find `A + B` and prove that it is `16`.

#### Step 1: Find the cube root of `912673`
First, we need to find the integer `n` such that `n³ = 912673`.

We can estimate the cube root:
- `99³ = 970299`
- `98³ = 941192`
- `97³ = 912673`

Thus, `97³ = 912673`, so `n = 97`.

But wait, we assumed `n` is an integer, but `AB` is a two-digit number, so `10 * A + B` is between `10` and `99`, and its cube is `912673`.

But `97³ = 912673`, so `10 * A + B = 97`.

Thus, `A = 9` and `B = 7`, so `A + B = 16`.

But we need to ensure that no other `n` satisfies `n³ = 912673` in the range of `10 * A + B`.

#### Step 2: Verify uniqueness of `n`
We know that `97³ = 912673` is the only cube in the range `100 ≤ n ≤ 999` that is a perfect cube.

To confirm, we can check the cubes of numbers around `97`:
- `96³ = 921600`
- `95³ = 857375`
- `94³ = 830584`
- `93³ = 804357`
- `92³ = 778688`
- `91³ = 753571`
- `90³ = 729000`
- `89³ = 704969`
- `88³ = 681472`
- `87³ = 658503`
- `86³ = 636056`
- `85³ = 614125`
- `84³ = 592704`
- `83³ = 571787`
- `82³ = 551368`
- `81³ = 531441`
- `80³ = 512000`
- `79³ = 493039`
- `78³ = 474552`
- `77³ = 456533`
- `76³ = 439044`
- `75³ = 421875`
- `74³ = 404964`
- `73³ = 388293`
- `72³ = 371992`
- `71³ = 356041`
- `70³ = 343000`

None of these cubes is `912673`, so `10 * A + B = 97` is the only solution.

#### Step 3: Solve for `A` and `B`
Given `10 * A + B = 97`, we can deduce:
1. `B = 97 - 10 * A`.
2. Since `B` is a digit (`0 ≤ B ≤ 9`), `97 - 10 * A` must be between `0` and `9`.
3. We can test possible values of `A`:
   - `A = 9`: `B = 97 - 90 = 7` (valid).
   - `A = 8`: `B = 97 - 80 = 17` (invalid, `B > 9`).
   - `A ≤ 7`: `B ≥ 27` (invalid, `B > 9`).
   - `A ≥ 10`: `B ≤ -3` (invalid, `B < 0`).

Thus, the only solution is `A = 9` and `B = 7`, so `A + B = 16`.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Find the cube root of `912673`**:
   - Calculate `97³ = 912673` to deduce `10 * A + B = 97`.

2. **Solve for `A` and `B`**:
   - From `10 * A + B = 97`, deduce `B = 97 - 10 * A`.
   - Enumerate possible values of `A` (`0 ≤ A ≤ 9`) to find `A = 9` and `B = 7` is the only valid solution.

3. **Verify uniqueness**:
   - Check that no other `A` in `0 ≤ A ≤ 9` gives a valid `B` (`0 ≤ B ≤ 9`).

4. **Conclude `A + B = 16`**:
   - The only solution is `A = 9` and `B = 7`, so `A + B = 16`.
