### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the remainder when the sum \( S = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{100} \) is divided by 7. 

#### Step 1: Find a closed-form expression for \( S \)
The sum \( S \) is a geometric series with first term \( a = 1 \), common ratio \( r = 2 \), and number of terms \( n = 101 \). The sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series is:
\[ S = a \cdot \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} = 1 \cdot \frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1. \]

#### Step 2: Compute \( 2^{101} \mod 7 \)
We need to find \( 2^{101} \mod 7 \). First, observe the cycle of \( 2^k \mod 7 \):
\[ 2^1 \equiv 2 \mod 7, \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \mod 7, \]
\[ 2^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7, \]
\[ 2^4 \equiv 2 \mod 7, \]
and so on. The cycle repeats every 3 powers: \( 2, 4, 1 \).

Since \( 101 \div 3 = 33 \) with a remainder of \( 2 \), we have:
\[ 2^{101} = 2^{3 \cdot 33 + 2} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 4 \mod 7 \equiv 4 \mod 7. \]

#### Step 3: Compute \( S \mod 7 \)
From Step 1, \( S = 2^{101} - 1 \). From Step 2, \( 2^{101} \equiv 4 \mod 7 \), so:
\[ S \equiv 4 - 1 \mod 7 \equiv 3 \mod 7. \]

Thus, the remainder is \( 3 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Recognize that the sum is a geometric series with first term \( 1 \), common ratio \( 2 \), and \( 101 \) terms.
   - Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to get \( S = 2^{101} - 1 \).

2. **Modulo Calculation**:
   - Find the cycle of \( 2^k \mod 7 \). The cycle is \( 2, 4, 1 \), repeating every 3 powers.
   - Compute \( 101 \mod 3 = 2 \), so \( 2^{101} \mod 7 = 4 \).

3. **Final Result**:
   - Substitute back to get \( S \mod 7 = 4 - 1 = 3 \).
