### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We have a system of three linear equations in three real variables \(a, b, c\):
1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)

We need to find the product \(abc\) and show that it is \(-56\).

**Approach:**
To find \(abc\), we can first solve for \(a, b, c\) using the given equations. The system is linear, so we can use elimination or substitution. Here, we will use elimination to eliminate variables step by step.

**Step 1: Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \(c\).**

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a + 3b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 9 - (-3) \]
\[ a + 3b + c - 3a - b - c = 12 \]
\[ -2a + 2b = 12 \]
\[ -a + b = 6 \quad \text{(Divide by 2)} \]
\[ b = a + 6 \]

**Step 2: Subtract the first equation from the third to eliminate \(c\).**

Subtract the first equation from the third:
\[ (a + b + 3c) - (3a + b + c) = 19 - (-3) \]
\[ a + b + 3c - 3a - b - c = 22 \]
\[ -2a + 2c = 22 \]
\[ -a + c = 11 \quad \text{(Divide by 2)} \]
\[ c = a + 11 \]

**Step 3: Substitute \(b = a + 6\) and \(c = a + 11\) into the first equation to find \(a\).**

Substitute \(b = a + 6\) and \(c = a + 11\) into the first equation:
\[ 3a + b + c = -3 \]
\[ 3a + (a + 6) + (a + 11) = -3 \]
\[ 3a + a + 6 + a + 11 = -3 \]
\[ 5a + 17 = -3 \]
\[ 5a = -20 \]
\[ a = -4 \]

**Step 4: Find \(b\) and \(c\) using \(a = -4\).**

From \(b = a + 6\):
\[ b = -4 + 6 = 2 \]

From \(c = a + 11\):
\[ c = -4 + 11 = 7 \]

**Verification:**
Check the original equations with \(a = -4\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 7\):
1. \(3a + b + c = 3(-4) + 2 + 7 = -12 + 2 + 7 = -3\) ✔️
2. \(a + 3b + c = -4 + 3(2) + 7 = -4 + 6 + 7 = 9\) ✔️
3. \(a + b + 3c = -4 + 2 + 3(7) = -4 + 2 + 21 = 19\) ✔️

**Conclusion:**
The values of \(a, b, c\) that satisfy the given system are \(a = -4\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 7\). The product \(abc\) is:
\[ abc = (-4)(2)(7) = -56 \]

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \(c\):**
   - Simplify \((a + 3b + c) - (3a + b + c)\) to get \(-2a + 2b = 12\).
   - Divide by 2 to get \(b = a + 6\).

2. **Subtract the first equation from the third to eliminate \(c\):**
   - Simplify \((a + b + 3c) - (3a + b + c)\) to get \(-2a + 2c = 22\).
   - Divide by 2 to get \(c = a + 11\).

3. **Substitute \(b = a + 6\) and \(c = a + 11\) into the first equation to find \(a\):**
   - Substitute into \(3a + b + c = -3\) to get \(5a + 17 = -3\).
   - Solve for \(a = -4\).

4. **Find \(b\) and \(c\) using \(a = -4\):**
   - \(b = a + 6 = 2\).
   - \(c = a + 11 = 7\).

5. **Calculate \(abc\):**
   - \(abc = (-4)(2)(7) = -56\).
