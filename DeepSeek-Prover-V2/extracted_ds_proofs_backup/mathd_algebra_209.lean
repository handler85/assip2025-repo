### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall that `σ : Equiv ℝ ℝ` is a bijective function from `ℝ` to `ℝ` with inverse functions `σ.1` and `σ.2`. The hypotheses are:
1. `σ.2 2 = 10` (i.e., `σ(10) = 2`),
2. `σ.2 10 = 1` (i.e., `σ(1) = 10`),
3. `σ.2 1 = 2` (i.e., `σ(2) = 1`).

The goal is to prove that `σ.1 (σ.1 10) = 1`.

#### Step 1: Understand the Hypotheses
The hypotheses are about the inverse function `σ.2` of `σ.1`. The first hypothesis `σ.2 2 = 10` is equivalent to `σ(10) = 2` because `σ.2` is the inverse of `σ.1`. Similarly, the other two hypotheses can be interpreted as:
1. `σ(1) = 10`,
2. `σ(2) = 1`.

#### Step 2: Compute `σ.1 10`
Since `σ(1) = 10`, the inverse function `σ.2` satisfies `σ.2 (10) = 1`. But this is exactly the second hypothesis `σ.2 10 = 1`, which is `σ(1) = 10`. 

But wait, this seems circular. The second hypothesis is `σ.2 10 = 1`, which is `σ(1) = 10`. 

But we need to compute `σ.1 10`. 

Since `σ(1) = 10`, the inverse function `σ.2` satisfies `σ.2 (10) = 1`, i.e., `σ.1 (10) = 1`. 

Thus, `σ.1 10 = 1`.

#### Step 3: Compute `σ.1 (σ.1 10)`
Since `σ.1 10 = 1`, we have `σ.1 (σ.1 10) = σ.1 1 = σ(1) = 10`. 

But wait, this contradicts the goal `σ.1 (σ.1 10) = 1`. 

This means that there is a mistake in the interpretation of the hypotheses or the goal.

#### Re-evaluating the Hypotheses
The hypotheses are:
1. `σ.2 2 = 10` (i.e., `σ(10) = 2`),
2. `σ.2 10 = 1` (i.e., `σ(1) = 10`),
3. `σ.2 1 = 2` (i.e., `σ(2) = 1`).

But the goal is `σ.1 (σ.1 10) = 1`. 

From `σ.2 10 = 1`, we have `σ.1 1 = 10` (since `σ.1` is the inverse of `σ.2`). 

But `σ.1 10` is not directly given. 

From `σ.2 2 = 10`, we have `σ.1 10 = 2` (since `σ.1` is the inverse of `σ.2`). 

Thus, `σ.1 (σ.1 10) = σ.1 2 = σ(2) = 1`. 

This matches the goal. 

#### Step 4: Summary of the Proof
1. From `σ.2 10 = 1`, we get `σ.1 1 = 10` (since `σ.1` is the inverse of `σ.2`).
2. From `σ.2 2 = 10`, we get `σ.1 10 = 2` (since `σ.1` is the inverse of `σ.2`).
3. Now, `σ.1 (σ.1 10) = σ.1 2 = σ(2) = 1` (by the third hypothesis).

### Step 5: Abstract Plan
1. Use the inverse relationship between `σ.1` and `σ.2` to derive `σ.1 1 = 10` from `σ.2 10 = 1`.
2. Similarly, derive `σ.1 10 = 2` from `σ.2 2 = 10`.
3. Compute `σ.1 (σ.1 10) = σ.1 2 = σ(2) = 1` using the given hypothesis `σ.2 1 = 2`.
