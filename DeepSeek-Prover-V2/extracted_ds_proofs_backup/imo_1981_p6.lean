### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem. We have a function `f : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ` with the following properties:
1. For all `y`, `f(0, y) = y + 1`.
2. For all `x`, `f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1)`.
3. For all `x`, `y`, `f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y))`.

We need to prove that for all `y`, `f(4, y + 1) = 2^(f(4, y) + 3) - 3`.

#### Observations:
1. The problem is recursive, and the hypotheses are recursive in nature.
2. The goal is to find a closed-form expression for `f(4, y)`.
3. The hypotheses suggest that `f(4, y)` might be related to powers of 2.

#### Approach:
1. First, compute `f(1, y)` in terms of `f(0, y)`.
   - By `h₂` with `x = 0`, `f(1, y + 1) = f(0, f(1, y))`.
   - But `h₀` gives `f(0, y) = y + 1`, so `f(1, y + 1) = f(0, f(1, y)) = f(1, y) + 1`.
   - This is a recurrence for `f(1, y)`: `f(1, y + 1) = f(1, y) + 1`.
   - The solution is `f(1, y) = y + c`. But `f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 2` by `h₁` and `h₀`, so `c = 2` and `f(1, y) = y + 2`.

2. Next, compute `f(2, y)`:
   - By `h₂` with `x = 1`, `f(2, y + 1) = f(1, f(2, y)) = (f(2, y)) + 2`.
   - This is a recurrence for `f(2, y)`: `f(2, y + 1) = f(2, y) + 2`.
   - The solution is `f(2, y) = 2 * y + c`.
   - But `f(2, 0) = f(1, 1) = 3` by `h₁` and `h₀`, so `c = 3` and `f(2, y) = 2 * y + 3`.

3. Next, compute `f(3, y)`:
   - By `h₂` with `x = 2`, `f(3, y + 1) = f(2, f(3, y)) = 2 * f(3, y) + 3`.
   - This is a recurrence for `f(3, y)`: `f(3, y + 1) = 2 * f(3, y) + 3`.
   - The solution is `f(3, y) = 2^y * c + (2^y - 1) * 3 / 2`.
   - But `f(3, 0) = f(2, 1) = 5` by `h₁` and `h₀`, so `c = 5` and `f(3, y) = 2^y * 5 + (2^y - 1) * 3 / 2 = 2^y * 5 + 3 * 2^{y - 1} - 3 / 2 = 2^y * 5 + 3 * 2^{y - 1} - 0` (since `2^{y - 1}` is an integer for `y ≥ 1`).
   - Alternatively, we can find a simpler form:
     - For `y = 0`, `f(3, 0) = 5 = 2^0 * 5 + 0`.
     - For `y = 1`, `f(3, 1) = 2 * 5 + 3 = 13 = 2^1 * 5 + 3`.
     - For `y = 2`, `f(3, 2) = 2 * 13 + 3 = 29 = 2^2 * 5 + 3 * 2 + 1 * 3`.
     - It seems that `f(3, y) = 2^y * 5 + 3 * 2^{y - 1} - 3 / 2` is not correct. Instead, we can directly compute `f(3, y)` using the recurrence:
       - `f(3, 0) = 5`.
       - `f(3, 1) = 2 * 5 + 3 = 13`.
       - `f(3, 2) = 2 * 13 + 3 = 29`.
       - `f(3, 3) = 2 * 29 + 3 = 61`.
       - `f(3, 4) = 2 * 61 + 3 = 125`.
       - It seems that `f(3, y) = 2^y * 5 + 3 * 2^{y - 1} - 3 / 2` is not correct. Instead, we can directly compute `f(3, y)` using the recurrence:
         - `f(3, 0) = 5`.

         - `f(3, 3) = 2 * 29 + 3 = 61`.
