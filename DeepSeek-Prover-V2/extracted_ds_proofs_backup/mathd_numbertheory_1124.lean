### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the problem: We have a four-digit number `374n` (where `n` is a digit, i.e., `0 ≤ n ≤ 9`), and we are told that `374n` is divisible by `18`. We need to find the value of `n` and show that it is `4`.

#### Key Observations:
1. A number is divisible by `18` if and only if it is divisible by both `2` and `9`.
2. A number is divisible by `2` if and only if its last digit is even.
3. A number is divisible by `9` if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by `9`.

#### Step 1: Check Divisibility by 2
The number `374n` is divisible by `2` if and only if `n` is even. This is because the last digit of `374n` is `n`, and `374n` is divisible by `2` if and only if `n` is even.

But we don't need this yet. We can directly use the condition that `374n` is divisible by `18` to find `n`.

#### Step 2: Check Divisibility by 9
The sum of the digits of `374n` is `3 + 7 + 4 + n = 14 + n`. For `374n` to be divisible by `9`, `14 + n` must be divisible by `9`.

Thus, we have:
\[ 14 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \]

Compute `14 mod 9`:
\[ 14 = 9 + 5 \implies 14 \equiv 5 \pmod{9} \]

So:
\[ 5 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \implies n \equiv -5 \equiv 4 \pmod{9} \]

Since `n` is a digit (`0 ≤ n ≤ 9`), the only solution is `n = 4`.

#### Verification:
For `n = 4`, the number is `3744`. The sum of its digits is `3 + 7 + 4 + 4 = 18`, which is divisible by `9`. The last digit is `4`, which is even, so it is divisible by `2`. Thus, `3744` is divisible by `18`.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We have a four-digit number `374n` where `n` is a digit (`0 ≤ n ≤ 9`).
   - The number `374n` is divisible by `18`.
   - We need to find `n`.

2. **Divisibility by 18**:
   - A number is divisible by `18` if and only if it is divisible by both `2` and `9`.

3. **Divisibility by 2**:
   - The last digit of `374n` is `n`.
   - `374n` is divisible by `2` if and only if `n` is even.

4. **Divisibility by 9**:
   - The sum of the digits of `374n` is `14 + n`.
   - `374n` is divisible by `9` if and only if `14 + n` is divisible by `9`.
   - Simplifying, `14 + n ≡ 0 mod 9` is equivalent to `n ≡ 4 mod 9`.

5. **Find `n`**:
   - Since `n` is a digit (`0 ≤ n ≤ 9`), the only solution is `n = 4`.

6. **Verification**:
   - For `n = 4`, `3744` is divisible by `18` (check `2` and `9`).
