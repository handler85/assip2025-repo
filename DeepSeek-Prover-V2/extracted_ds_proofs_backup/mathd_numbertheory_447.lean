### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to find the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50. However, the Lean statement is slightly different: it asks for the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 1 and 49 (inclusive), and then checks that this sum is 78. 

But wait, the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are 0, 3, 6, ..., 48. The units digits of these numbers are 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, ... (since 51 is not included). The sum of the units digits is 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 = 45. 

But this contradicts the Lean statement, which claims the sum is 78. 

Upon closer inspection, the Lean statement is:
```lean4
(∑ k in Finset.filter (fun x => 3 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 1 49), k % 10) = 78
```
This means we are summing the units digits of all numbers in `Finset.Icc 1 49` that are divisible by 3. The numbers in `Finset.Icc 1 49` are 1, 2, ..., 49. The multiples of 3 in this range are 3, 6, ..., 48. The units digits of these numbers are 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0. 

The sum of these units digits is:
3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 = 45. 

But the Lean statement claims the sum is 78. 

This suggests that there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the Lean formalization. 

However, if we consider the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, the units digits are:
0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, ... 

The sum of the first 10 units digits is:
0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 45. 

But the sum of the first 11 units digits is:
45 + 0 = 45. 

This is not 78. 

Alternatively, if we consider the multiples of 3 between 0 and 48, the units digits are:
0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, ... 

The sum of the first 10 units digits is:
0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 45. 

But the sum of the first 11 units digits is:
45 + 0 = 45. 

This is not 78. 

Alternatively, if we consider the multiples of 3 between 0 and 51, the units digits are:
0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0. 

The sum of the first 51 units digits is:
