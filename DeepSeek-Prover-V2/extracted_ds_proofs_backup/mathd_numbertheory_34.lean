### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall the problem:
Find \( x \in \mathbb{N} \) such that \( x < 100 \), \( x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \mod 100 \), and \( x = 89 \).

We are to prove that \( x = 89 \) is the unique solution under the given conditions.

#### Step 1: Understand the Congruence
The condition \( x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \mod 100 \) means that \( x \cdot 9 - 1 \) is divisible by 100, i.e., \( x \cdot 9 - 1 = 100k \) for some integer \( k \).

#### Step 2: Find Possible \( x \)
We can rearrange the equation to find possible values of \( x \):
\[ x \cdot 9 = 100k + 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{100k + 1}{9} \]

Since \( x \) is a natural number, \( 100k + 1 \) must be divisible by 9. We can check the condition \( 100k + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \):
\[ 100 \equiv 1 \mod 9 \]
\[ 100k + 1 \equiv k + 1 \mod 9 \]
Thus, \( k + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \), i.e., \( k \equiv -1 \equiv 8 \mod 9 \).

So, \( k = 9m + 8 \) for some integer \( m \). Substitute back:
\[ x = \frac{100(9m + 8) + 1}{9} = \frac{900m + 800 + 1}{9} = \frac{900m + 801}{9} \]
\[ x = 100m + 89 \]

#### Step 3: Find \( x < 100 \)
Since \( x < 100 \), we have:
\[ 100m + 89 < 100 \]
\[ 100m < 11 \]
\[ m \leq 0 \]

Thus, the only possible value is \( m = 0 \), giving \( x = 89 \).

#### Verification
For \( x = 89 \):
\[ 89 \cdot 9 = 801 \]
\[ 801 \mod 100 = 1 \]
This is correct.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Congruence**:
   - The condition \( x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \mod 100 \) means \( x \cdot 9 - 1 \) is divisible by 100.

2. **Find Possible \( x \)**:
   - Rearrange to \( x \cdot 9 = 100k + 1 \).
   - Find \( k \) such that \( 100k + 1 \) is divisible by 9.
   - Solve for \( k \) and back-substitute to find \( x \).

3. **Find \( x < 100 \)**:
   - Enforce \( x < 100 \) to find the valid \( x \).

4. **Verification**:
   - Check that \( x = 89 \) satisfies the original condition.
