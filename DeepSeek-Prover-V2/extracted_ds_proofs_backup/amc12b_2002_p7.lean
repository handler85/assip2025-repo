### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given three consecutive positive integers \(a, b, c\) such that:
1. \(b = a + 1\),
2. \(c = b + 1 = a + 2\),
3. \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 8 \cdot (a + b + c)\).

We need to find \(a^2 + (b^2 + c^2) = 77\).

#### Step 1: Substitute \(b\) and \(c\) in terms of \(a\)
Given \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = a + 2\), substitute these into the product equation:
\[
a \cdot b \cdot c = a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 8 \cdot (a + b + c) = 8 \cdot (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2)) = 8 \cdot (3a + 3) = 24(a + 1).
\]
So, we have:
\[
a(a + 1)(a + 2) = 24(a + 1).
\]

#### Step 2: Factor and Solve for \(a\)
Since \(a > 0\) and \(a + 1 > 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a + 1\) to get:
\[
a(a + 2) = 24.
\]
This is a quadratic equation:
\[
a^2 + 2a - 24 = 0.
\]
Solve for \(a\):
\[
a = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 96}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2}.
\]
Thus, the solutions are:
\[
a = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad a = \frac{-12}{2} = -6.
\]
Since \(a > 0\), we have \(a = 4\).

#### Step 3: Find \(b\) and \(c\)
Given \(a = 4\), we have:
\[
b = a + 1 = 5, \quad c = a + 2 = 6.
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Product Condition
Check the product condition:
\[
a \cdot b \cdot c = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120,
\]
and:
\[
8 \cdot (a + b + c) = 8 \cdot (4 + 5 + 6) = 8 \cdot 15 = 120.
\]
The condition is satisfied.

#### Step 5: Compute the Sum of Squares
Finally, compute:
\[
a^2 + (b^2 + c^2) = 4^2 + (5^2 + 6^2) = 16 + (25 + 36) = 16 + 61 = 77.
\]

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Substitute \(b\) and \(c\) in terms of \(a\)**:
   - Given \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = a + 2\), substitute into the product equation.

2. **Simplify the product equation**:
   - Expand \(a \cdot b \cdot c\) and \(8 \cdot (a + b + c)\) to get \(a(a + 1)(a + 2) = 24(a + 1)\).

3. **Solve for \(a\)**:
   - Divide both sides by \((a + 1)\) to get \(a(a + 2) = 24\).
   - Solve the quadratic equation to find \(a = 4\) (since \(a > 0\)).

4. **Find \(b\) and \(c\)**:
   - Substitute \(a = 4\) to get \(b = 5\) and \(c = 6\).

5. **Verify the product condition**:
   - Check that \(4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 8 \cdot (4 + 5 + 6)\).

6. **Compute the sum of squares**:
   - Calculate \(4^2 + (5^2 + 6^2) = 77\).
