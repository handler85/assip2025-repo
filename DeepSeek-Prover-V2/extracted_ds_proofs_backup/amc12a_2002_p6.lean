### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We are given a positive integer `n` (`0 < n`). We need to find a positive integer `m` such that `m > n` and there exists a positive integer `p` (or any integer `p ≥ 0` in the original problem, but Lean's `Nat` is `≥ 0`) satisfying `m * p ≤ m + p`.

However, the Lean statement is slightly different:
- `m` is a natural number (`m : ℕ`), and `m > n` is `m ≥ n + 1` (since `n : ℕ`).
- The condition is `∃ p, m * p ≤ m + p`, where `p : ℕ`.

But notice that for `p = 0`, `m * p = 0 ≤ m + p = m` is true if `m ≥ 0` (which it is). So `p = 0` is always a solution.

But the problem is that `p` is a natural number (`p : ℕ`), and `m * p ≤ m + p` is not necessarily true for `p = 0` if `m = 0` (but `m > n` and `n ≥ 1` implies `m ≥ 2`).

But wait, the condition is `m > n` and `∃ p, m * p ≤ m + p`.

For `p = 0`, `m * p = 0 ≤ m + p = m` is true if `m ≥ 0` (which it is).

Thus, `p = 0` is always a solution, regardless of `m` (as long as `m : ℕ`).

But we need `m > n` (`m ≥ n + 1`).

Thus, we can choose `m = n + 1` (`m > n`).

Then `p = 0` is a solution, and `m * p = 0 ≤ m + p = m = n + 1` is true.

Thus, the solution is `m = n + 1` and `p = 0`.

But wait, the problem is that `p` is a natural number (`p : ℕ`), and `m * p ≤ m + p` is not necessarily true for `p = 0` if `m = 0` (but `m > n` and `n ≥ 1` implies `m ≥ 2`).

But in our case, `m = n + 1 ≥ 2` (since `n ≥ 1`), and `p = 0` is a solution because `m * p = 0 ≤ m + p = m = n + 1 ≥ 2 > 0`.

Thus, the solution is correct.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Choose `m`**:
   - Let `m = n + 1`. This ensures `m > n` because `n` is a positive integer (`n ≥ 1`).

2. **Find `p`**:
   - Let `p = 0`. This is a valid choice because:
     - `m * p = (n + 1) * 0 = 0`.
     - `m + p = n + 1 + 0 = n + 1`.
     - The inequality `m * p ≤ m + p` becomes `0 ≤ n + 1`, which is true since `n ≥ 1`.

3. **Verification**:
   - `m = n + 1 > n` because `n ≥ 1`.
   - `p = 0` is a natural number.
   - `m * p ≤ m + p` is `0 ≤ n + 1`, which is true.
