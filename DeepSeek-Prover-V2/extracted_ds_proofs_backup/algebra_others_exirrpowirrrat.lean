### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem Analysis:**
We need to find irrational numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^b\) is rational.

**Key Observations:**
1. The irrationality of \(a\) and \(b\) is independent of the rationality of \(a^b\).
2. The condition \(a^b \in \mathbb{Q}\) can be satisfied by choosing \(a\) and \(b\) appropriately.
3. A natural choice is to take \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\), but \(b = 0\) is rational, so this doesn't work.
4. Another choice is to take \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 2\), but \(a^b = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \in \mathbb{Q}\), and \(b = 2\) is rational. This also doesn't work.
5. A better choice is to take \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \log_2 9\), but \(b\) is irrational (since \(9\) is not a power of \(2\)), and \(a^b = (\sqrt{2})^{\log_2 9} = 9\) (since \((\sqrt{2})^{\log_2 9} = (2^{1/2})^{\log_2 9} = 2^{(\log_2 9)/2} = 2^{\log_2 3} = 3\) is incorrect. The correct calculation is:
   \[
   (\sqrt{2})^{\log_2 9} = (2^{1/2})^{\log_2 9} = 2^{(\log_2 9)/2} = 2^{\log_2 3} = 3.
   \]
   So \(a^b = 3 \in \mathbb{Q}\). This choice doesn't work either.
6. A correct choice is to take \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \log_2 4 = 2\), but \(b = 2\) is rational. Alternatively, take \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \log_2 8 = 3\), but \(b = 3\) is rational.
7. A better choice is to take \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \log_2 2 = 1\), but \(b = 1\) is rational.
8. The correct choice is to take \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \log_2 \frac{1}{2} = \log_2 2^{-1} = -1\), but \(b = -1\) is rational.
9. The only remaining choice is to take \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \log_2 \sqrt{2} = \log_2 2^{1/2} = \frac{1}{2}\), but \(b = \frac{1}{2}\) is rational.

This exhaustive search suggests that the only way to satisfy \(a^b \in \mathbb{Q}\) is to choose \(b\) such that \(a^b\) is rational. However, we can find \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^b\) is rational by choosing \(a\) and \(b\) appropriately.

But wait, we can choose \(a = 2\) and \(b = 0\), but \(b = 0\) is rational. Alternatively, \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\) gives \(a^b = 2 \in \mathbb{Q}\).
