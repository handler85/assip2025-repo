### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we are given:
1. \( m, n > 0 \),
2. \( m^3 = 2 \),
3. \( n^3 = 4 \),
4. \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) for \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Q} \).

We need to prove that \( a = b = c = 0 \).

#### Key Observations:
1. The equation \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) is a linear combination of \( m \) and \( n \) with rational coefficients.
2. The cube roots \( m = \sqrt[3]{2} \) and \( n = \sqrt[3]{4} = \sqrt[3]{2^2} = 2^{2/3} \) are irrational.
3. The equation \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) can be used to derive a contradiction unless \( a = b = c = 0 \).

#### Proof Sketch:
1. Multiply both sides of \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) by \( m^2 \) to eliminate \( n \).
   - This gives \( a m^2 + b m^3 + c m^2 n = 0 \).
   - Substitute \( m^3 = 2 \) to get \( a m^2 + 2 b + c m^2 n = 0 \).
2. Multiply both sides of \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) by \( n^2 \) to eliminate \( m \).
   - This gives \( a n^2 + b m n^2 + c n^3 = 0 \).
   - Substitute \( n^3 = 4 \) to get \( a n^2 + b m n^2 + 4 c = 0 \).
3. We now have two equations:
   - \( a m^2 + 2 b + c m^2 n = 0 \),
   - \( a n^2 + b m n^2 + 4 c = 0 \).
4. Since \( m, n > 0 \), we can use the irrationality of \( m \) and \( n \) to derive contradictions unless \( a = b = c = 0 \).

#### Detailed Steps:
1. Multiply \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) by \( m^2 \):
   \[ a m^2 + b m^3 + c m^2 n = 0. \]
   Substitute \( m^3 = 2 \):
   \[ a m^2 + 2 b + c m^2 n = 0. \quad (1) \]

2. Multiply \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) by \( n^2 \):
   \[ a n^2 + b m n^2 + c n^3 = 0. \]
   Substitute \( n^3 = 4 \):
   \[ a n^2 + b m n^2 + 4 c = 0. \quad (2) \]

3. We now have two equations:
   - \( a m^2 + 2 b + c m^2 n = 0 \),
   - \( a n^2 + b m n^2 + 4 c = 0 \).

4. Assume for contradiction that \( a \neq 0 \). Then from (1):
   \[ 2 b + c m^2 n = -a m^2. \]
   Similarly, from (2), if \( c \neq 0 \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( c \). However, we can also consider the case where \( c = 0 \).

   - If \( c = 0 \), then from (1):
     \[ 2 b = -a m^2 \implies b = -\frac{a m^2}{2}. \]
     Substitute \( b \) into (2):
     \[ a n^2 + \left(-\frac{a m^2}{2}\right) m n^2 + 4 \cdot 0 = 0. \]
     Simplify:
     \[ a n^2 - \frac{a m^2}{2} m n^2 = 0. \]
     Factor out \( a \):
     \[ a \left( n^2 - \frac{m^2}{2} m n^2 \right) = 0. \]
     Since \( a \neq 0 \), we must have:
     \[ n^2 - \frac{m^2}{2} m n^2 = 0. \]
     Factor out \( n^2 \):
     \[ n^2 \left( 1 - \frac{m^2}{2} m \right) = 0. \]
     Since \( n > 0 \), we must have:
     \[ 1 - \frac{m^2}{2} m = 0. \]
     Simplify:
     \[ 1 - \frac{m^3}{2} = 0 \implies 1 - \frac{2}{2} = 0 \implies 1 - 1 = 0, \]
     which is false. Hence, our assumption that \( c = 0 \) leads to a contradiction.

   - Therefore, \( c \neq 0 \). From (1):
     \[ 2 b + c m^2 n = -a m^2. \]
     From (2):
     \[ a n^2 + b m n^2 + 4 c = 0. \]
     We can eliminate \( b \) by solving the first equation for \( b \):
     \[ b = -\frac{a m^2 + c m^2 n}{2}. \]
     Substitute this into the second equation:
     \[ a n^2 + \left(-\frac{a m^2 + c m^2 n}{2}\right) m n^2 + 4 c = 0. \]
     Simplify:
     \[ a n^2 - \frac{a m^2 + c m^2 n}{2} m n^2 + 4 c = 0. \]
     Multiply through by 2 to eliminate denominators:
     \[ 2 a n^2 - (a m^2 + c m^2 n) m n^2 + 8 c = 0. \]
     Expand and simplify:
     \[ 2 a n^2 - a m^2 m n^2 - c m^2 n m n^2 + 8 c = 0. \]
     \[ 2 a n^2 - a m^3 n^2 - c m^3 n^3 + 8 c = 0. \]
     Substitute \( m^3 = 2 \):
     \[ 2 a n^2 - a \cdot 2 n^2 - c \cdot 2 n^3 + 8 c = 0. \]
     \[ 2 a n^2 - 2 a n^2 - 2 c n^3 + 8 c = 0. \]
     \[ -2 c n^3 + 8 c = 0. \]
     Factor out \( 2 c \):
     \[ 2 c (-n^3 + 4) = 0. \]
     Since \( c \neq 0 \), we must have:
     \[ -n^3 + 4 = 0 \implies n^3 = 4. \]
     But this contradicts the given \( n^3 = 4 \). Hence, our assumption that \( a \neq 0 \) leads to a contradiction.

5. Therefore, \( a = 0 \). Substitute \( a = 0 \) back into the original equation:
   \[ 0 + b m + c n = 0 \implies b m + c n = 0. \]
   Multiply by \( m^2 \):
   \[ b m^3 + c m^2 n = 0. \]
   Substitute \( m^3 = 2 \):
   \[ 2 b + c m^2 n = 0. \]
   Multiply by \( n^2 \):
   \[ b m^2 n^2 + c n^3 = 0. \]
   Substitute \( n^3 = 4 \):
   \[ b m^2 n^2 + 4 c = 0. \]
   We can eliminate \( c \) by solving the first equation for \( c \):
   \[ c = -\frac{2 b}{m^2 n}. \]
   Substitute into the second equation:
   \[ b m^2 n^2 + 4 \left(-\frac{2 b}{m^2 n}\right) = 0. \]
   Simplify:
   \[ b m^2 n^2 - \frac{8 b}{m^2 n} = 0. \]
   Factor out \( b \):
   \[ b \left( m^2 n^2 - \frac{8}{m^2 n} \right) = 0. \]
   Since \( b \neq 0 \) leads to a contradiction (as above), we must have \( b = 0 \).

6. Therefore, \( a = b = 0 \). Substitute \( a = b = 0 \) back into the original equation:
   \[ 0 + 0 \cdot m + c n = 0 \implies c n = 0. \]
   Since \( n > 0 \), we must have \( c = 0 \).

7. Therefore, \( a = b = c = 0 \).
