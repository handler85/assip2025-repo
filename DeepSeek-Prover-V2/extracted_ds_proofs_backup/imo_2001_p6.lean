### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's carefully restate the problem and the given conditions.

**Given:**
- Positive integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that:
  1. \(a > b > c > d > 0\) (but wait, the Lean code says \(d < c < b < a\) and all are positive, so \(a > b > c > d > 0\) is correct).
  2. The equation:
     \[
     a c + b d = (b + d + a - c)(b + d + c - a).
     \]
- We need to prove that \(a b + c d\) is not a prime number.

**Observations:**
1. The right-hand side (RHS) of the equation can be simplified. Let's denote:
   \[
   x = b + d + a - c, \quad y = b + d + c - a.
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   x y = (b + d + a - c)(b + d + c - a).
   \]
   The RHS of the original equation is \(x y\), so the equation becomes:
   \[
   a c + b d = x y.
   \]
   But \(x = b + d + a - c\) and \(y = b + d + c - a\), so:
   \[
   x + y = (b + d + a - c) + (b + d + c - a) = 2(b + d).
   \]
   Also, \(x - y = (b + d + a - c) - (b + d + c - a) = 2(a - c)\).
   But we don't need these directly.

2. The condition \(a > b > c > d > 0\) is given, and we can use it to bound the terms. For example:
   - \(a c > d c\) because \(a > d\) and \(c > 0\).
   - Similarly, \(a c + b d > d c + b d = d(c + b)\).
   - The RHS is \((b + d + a - c)(b + d + c - a)\). Since \(a > c\), \(b + d + a - c > b + d\). Similarly, \(b + d + c - a < b + d + c\) (because \(a > 0\)). But we can also note that:
     \[
     (b + d + a - c)(b + d + c - a) = (b + d)^2 - a^2 + 2(b + d)c - 2 a c.
     \]
     This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find a better bound.

3. Alternatively, we can try to find a contradiction by assuming that \(a b + c d\) is prime. Let's denote:
   \[
   S = a b + c d.
   \]
   We need to find a contradiction to the primality of \(S\).

   From the given equation:
   \[
   a c + b d = (b + d + a - c)(b + d + c - a),
   \]
   we can expand the RHS:
   \[
   (b + d + a - c)(b + d + c - a) = (b + d)^2 - a^2 + 2(b + d)c - 2 a c.
   \]
   This seems messy, but perhaps we can find a better approach.

4. A better approach is to consider the symmetry and the given inequalities. We can try to find a lower bound for \(S = a b + c d\) and show that it cannot be prime.

   From \(a > b > c > d > 0\), we have:
   - \(a b > c b\) because \(a > c\) and \(b > 0\).
   - Similarly, \(a b > a d\) because \(b > d\) and \(a > 0\).
   - \(c d > d^2\) because \(c > d\) and \(d > 0\).

   But we need a lower bound for \(S = a b + c d\). Notice that:
   \[
   S = a b + c d > c b + c d = c (b + d).
   \]
   Similarly, \(S > a d + c d = d (a + c)\).

   But we can also find a lower bound by considering the product \(a b + c d\) and the given equation.

   From the given equation:
   \[
   a c + b d = (b + d + a - c)(b + d + c - a),
   \]
   we can denote \(x = b + d + a - c\) and \(y = b + d + c - a\). Then:
   \[
   a c + b d = x y.
   \]
   Also, \(x + y = 2(b + d)\) and \(x - y = 2(a - c)\).

   We can try to find a relationship between \(S = a b + c d\) and \(x y = a c + b d\).

   Notice that:
   \[
   S = a b + c d = a b + c d + 0 = a b + c d + (a c + b d - a c - b d) = a b + c d + (a c + b d) - (a c + b d).
   \]
   This seems circular. Instead, let's consider the following:
   \[
   S = a b + c d = a b + c d + 0 = a b + c d + (a c + b d - a c - b d) = a b + c d + (a c + b d) - (a c + b d).
   \]
   This is not helpful. Let's try another approach.

5. A better approach is to consider the given equation modulo \(a - c\) or \(b - d\). However, this seems complicated given the current form.

6. Instead, let's try to find a contradiction by assuming that \(S = a b + c d\) is prime. Since \(S > 1\) (because \(a, b, c, d \geq 1\) and at least one of them is \(\geq 2\)), and \(S\) is a product of two integers, one of which is \(\geq 2\), we can find a contradiction.

   For example, if \(a \geq 2\), then \(a b \geq 2 b \geq 2\) (since \(b \geq 1\)), and similarly \(c d \geq 1\) (since \(c \geq 1\) and \(d \geq 1\)). Thus, \(S = a b + c d \geq 2 + 1 = 3\). If \(S\) is prime, then \(S\) cannot be divisible by any integer other than \(1\) and itself. But \(S\) is divisible by \(a\) (since \(a b\) is divisible by \(a\)) and \(S\) is divisible by \(b\) (since \(b d\) is divisible by \(b\)), unless \(a = b = 1\). But if \(a = b = 1\), then \(S = 1 + c d \geq 1 + 1 = 2\), and \(S\) is prime only if \(S = 2\), which would require \(c d = 1\), i.e., \(c = d = 1\). But then \(a = b = c = d = 1\), which contradicts \(a > b > c > d > 0\).

   Therefore, our assumption that \(S\) is prime leads to a contradiction, and \(S\) cannot be prime.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Given Equation**:
   - The equation is \(a c + b d = (b + d + a - c)(b + d + c - a)\).
   - Let \(x = b + d + a - c\) and \(y = b + d + c - a\).
   - Then \(x y = a c + b d\).

2. **Find a Lower Bound for \(S = a b + c d\)**:
   - Since \(a > b > c > d > 0\), we have \(a b > c b\) and \(a b > a d\).
   - Also, \(c d > d^2\) because \(c > d\).
   - Thus, \(S = a b + c d > c b + d^2\).

3. **Assume \(S\) is Prime and Find a Contradiction**:
   - If \(S\) is prime, then \(S\) cannot be divisible by any integer other than \(1\) and itself.
   - But \(S\) is divisible by \(a\) (since \(a b\) is divisible by \(a\)) and \(S\) is divisible by \(b\) (since \(b d\) is divisible by \(b\)), unless \(a = b = 1\).
   - If \(a = b = 1\), then \(S = 1 + c d \geq 1 + 1 = 2\), and \(S\) is prime only if \(S = 2\), which would require \(c d = 1\), i.e., \(c = d = 1\).
   - But then \(a = b = c = d = 1\), which contradicts \(a > b > c > d > 0\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Our assumption that \(S\) is prime leads to a contradiction.
   - Therefore, \(S\) cannot be prime.
