### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. The Lean statement is:

**Theorem**: It is **not** true that for all integers `a` and `b`, the following equivalence holds:
1. `a` and `b` are both even (i.e., there exist integers `i` and `j` such that `a = 2 * i` and `b = 2 * j`).
2. `a² + b²` is divisible by `8` (i.e., there exists an integer `k` such that `a² + b² = 8 * k`).

In other words, the statement is false because there exist integers `a` and `b` such that `a` and `b` are both even, but `a² + b²` is **not** divisible by `8`.

#### Key Observations:
1. The condition `a` and `b` are both even is equivalent to `2 ∣ a` and `2 ∣ b`, i.e., `a` and `b` are divisible by `2`.
2. The condition `8 ∣ a² + b²` is equivalent to `a² + b² ≡ 0 mod 8`.
3. We need to find integers `a` and `b` such that `2 ∣ a`, `2 ∣ b`, but `8 ∤ a² + b²`.

#### Finding a Counterexample:
Let's try small even integers.

1. Let `a = 2` and `b = 2`:
   - `a² + b² = 4 + 4 = 8 = 8 * 1`, so `8 ∣ a² + b²`.
   - This does **not** work because `8 ∣ a² + b²` is true.

2. Let `a = 2` and `b = 4`:
   - `a² + b² = 4 + 16 = 20 = 8 * 2 + 4`, so `8 ∤ a² + b²`.
   - This works! `a` and `b` are both even (`2 ∣ 2`, `2 ∣ 4`), but `8 ∤ 20`.

Thus, `a = 2` and `b = 4` is a counterexample.

#### Verification:
1. `a` and `b` are both even:
   - `2 = 2 * 1`, `4 = 2 * 2`, so `∃ i j, a = 2 * i ∧ b = 2 * j` is true.
2. `8 ∤ a² + b²`:
   - `a² + b² = 20`, and `20 = 8 * 2 + 4`, so `8 ∤ 20` is true.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Lean Statement**:
   - The statement is `¬∀ a b : ℤ, (∃ i j, a = 2 * i ∧ b = 2 * j) ↔ ∃ k, a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 8 * k`.
   - This means we need to find integers `a` and `b` such that:
     - `a` and `b` are both even (`∃ i j, a = 2 * i ∧ b = 2 * j` is true).
     - `a² + b²` is **not** divisible by `8` (`∃ k, a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 8 * k` is false).

2. **Find a Counterexample**:
   - Try small even integers for `a` and `b`.
   - `a = 2`, `b = 4` is a candidate:
     - `a` and `b` are even.
     - `a² + b² = 4 + 16 = 20`, which is not divisible by `8`.

3. **Verify the Counterexample**:
   - `20 = 8 * 2 + 4`, so `20` is not divisible by `8`.
   - Thus, `∃ k, a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 8 * k` is false.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The integers `a = 2` and `b = 4` satisfy:
     - `a` and `b` are both even.
     - `a² + b²` is **not** divisible by `8`.
   - Therefore, the original statement is false.
