### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the sequence \( D_n \) defined by:
- \( D_0 = 0 \),
- \( D_1 = 0 \),
- \( D_2 = 1 \),
- For \( n \geq 3 \), \( D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \).

We are to determine the parities of \( D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023} \).

#### Step 1: Find the Periodicity of the Sequence Modulo 2

To determine the parity of \( D_n \), we can study the sequence modulo 2. The recurrence relation modulo 2 is:
- \( D_0 \equiv 0 \mod 2 \),
- \( D_1 \equiv 0 \mod 2 \),
- \( D_2 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \),
- For \( n \geq 3 \), \( D_n \equiv D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \mod 2 \).

This is a linear recurrence relation modulo 2. We can compute the first few terms to find the period:
- \( D_0 \equiv 0 \),
- \( D_1 \equiv 0 \),
- \( D_2 \equiv 1 \),
- \( D_3 \equiv D_2 + D_0 \equiv 1 + 0 \equiv 1 \),
- \( D_4 \equiv D_3 + D_1 \equiv 1 + 0 \equiv 1 \),
- \( D_5 \equiv D_4 + D_2 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 0 \),
- \( D_6 \equiv D_5 + D_3 \equiv 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \),
- \( D_7 \equiv D_6 + D_4 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 0 \),
- \( D_8 \equiv D_7 + D_5 \equiv 0 + 0 \equiv 0 \),
- \( D_9 \equiv D_8 + D_6 \equiv 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \),
- \( D_{10} \equiv D_9 + D_7 \equiv 1 + 0 \equiv 1 \),
- \( D_{11} \equiv D_{10} + D_8 \equiv 1 + 0 \equiv 1 \),
- \( D_{12} \equiv D_{11} + D_9 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 0 \).

We observe that the sequence modulo 2 repeats every 12 terms. The period is 12.

#### Step 2: Determine the Parity of \( D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023} \)

Given the period is 12, we can find the position of \( D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023} \) modulo 12:
- \( 2021 \mod 12 = 2021 - 12 \times 168 = 2021 - 2016 = 5 \),
- \( 2022 \mod 12 = 2022 - 12 \times 168 = 2022 - 2016 = 6 \),
- \( 2023 \mod 12 = 2023 - 12 \times 168 = 2023 - 2016 = 7 \).

Thus, the parities of \( D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023} \) are the same as the parities of \( D_5, D_6, D_7 \), respectively.

From the earlier computation:
- \( D_5 \equiv 0 \mod 2 \),
- \( D_6 \equiv 1 \mod 2 \),
- \( D_7 \equiv 0 \mod 2 \).

Therefore:
- \( D_{2021} \) is even,
- \( D_{2022} \) is odd,
- \( D_{2023} \) is even.

This gives the answer:
\[
\boxed{(E, O, E)}
\]

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Recurrence Relation**:
   - The sequence is defined by \( D_0 = 0 \), \( D_1 = 0 \), \( D_2 = 1 \), and for \( n \geq 3 \), \( D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \).

2. **Find the Periodicity Modulo 2**:
   - Compute the sequence modulo 2 until a repeating cycle is found.
   - Observe that the sequence repeats every 12 terms modulo 2.

3. **Determine the Parity of \( D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023} \)**:
   - Find the position of \( 2021, 2022, 2023 \) modulo 12.
   - Use the periodicity to determine the parity of \( D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023} \).

4. **Conclude the Answer**:
   - The parities are \( (E, O, E) \).
