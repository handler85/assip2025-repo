### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given two equations:
1. \( 3y = x \) (Equation 1)
2. \( 2x + 5y = 11 \) (Equation 2)

We need to find the sum \( x + y \) and show that it equals 4.

**Approach:**
1. Substitute \( x \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2 to eliminate \( x \).
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( y \).
3. Substitute the value of \( y \) back into Equation 1 to find \( x \).
4. Compute \( x + y \) and verify that it is 4.

**Detailed Solution:**

1. From Equation 1, we have \( x = 3y \).

2. Substitute \( x = 3y \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2(3y) + 5y = 11
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   6y + 5y = 11 \implies 11y = 11 \implies y = 1
   \]

3. Substitute \( y = 1 \) back into \( x = 3y \):
   \[
   x = 3 \cdot 1 = 3
   \]

4. Compute \( x + y \):
   \[
   x + y = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]

Thus, the sum of the coordinates of point \( A \) is \( 4 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Substitute \( x \) in terms of \( y \) from the first equation into the second equation.**
   - Given \( x = 3y \), substitute into \( 2x + 5y = 11 \).

2. **Solve for \( y \).**
   - Substitute \( x = 3y \) into the second equation to get \( 11y = 11 \).
   - Divide both sides by 11 to find \( y = 1 \).

3. **Find \( x \) using the value of \( y \).**
   - Substitute \( y = 1 \) back into \( x = 3y \) to get \( x = 3 \).

4. **Compute the sum \( x + y \).**
   - Add \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 1 \) to get \( x + y = 4 \).
