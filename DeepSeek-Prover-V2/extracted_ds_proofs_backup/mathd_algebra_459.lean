### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we have the following system of equations:
1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)    (1)
2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)    (2)
3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)    (3)
4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)  (4)

We need to find \( d \) in its reduced form \( \frac{n}{d} \) and compute \( n + d \).

#### Step 1: Subtract Equations to Eliminate \( d \)

Subtract (2) from (1):
\[ 3a - 4b = (b + c + d) - (a + c + d) \]
\[ 3a - 4b = b + c + d - a - c - d \]
\[ 3a - 4b = b - a \]
\[ 3a - 4b + a = b \]
\[ 4a - 4b = b \]
\[ 4a = 5b \]
\[ a = \frac{5b}{4} \]

Subtract (3) from (2):
\[ 4b - 2c = (a + c + d) - (a + b + d) \]
\[ 4b - 2c = a + c + d - a - b - d \]
\[ 4b - 2c = c - b \]
\[ 4b - 2c + b = c \]
\[ 5b - 2c = c \]
\[ 5b = 3c \]
\[ c = \frac{5b}{3} \]

Substitute \( a = \frac{5b}{4} \) and \( c = \frac{5b}{3} \) into (4):
\[ 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \]
\[ 8 \cdot \frac{5b}{4} + 10b + 6 \cdot \frac{5b}{3} = 24 \]
\[ 10b + 10b + 10b = 24 \]
\[ 30b = 24 \]
\[ b = \frac{24}{30} = \frac{4}{5} \]

Now, we can find \( a \) and \( c \):
\[ a = \frac{5b}{4} = \frac{5 \cdot \frac{4}{5}}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]
\[ c = \frac{5b}{3} = \frac{5 \cdot \frac{4}{5}}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Finally, we can find \( d \) using (1):
\[ 3a = b + c + d \]
\[ 3 \cdot 1 = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4}{3} + d \]
\[ 3 = \frac{12}{15} + \frac{20}{15} + d \]
\[ 3 = \frac{32}{15} + d \]
\[ d = 3 - \frac{32}{15} = \frac{45}{15} - \frac{32}{15} = \frac{13}{15} \]

Thus, \( d = \frac{13}{15} \), and the numerator and denominator sum to \( 13 + 15 = 28 \).

### Step 2: Abstract Plan

1. **Subtract Equations to Eliminate \( d \)**:
   - Subtract (2) from (1) to get \( 4a = 5b \).
   - Subtract (3) from (2) to get \( 5b = 3c \).
   - Substitute \( a = \frac{5b}{4} \) and \( c = \frac{5b}{3} \) into (4) to find \( b \).

2. **Find \( a \) and \( c \)**:
   - Use \( b \) to find \( a \) and \( c \).

3. **Find \( d \)**:
   - Use \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) to find \( d \).

4. **Verify the Sum**:
   - The numerator and denominator of \( d \) sum to 28.

### Step 3: Lean 4 `have` Statements
