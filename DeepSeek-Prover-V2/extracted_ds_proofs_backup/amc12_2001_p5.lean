### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem correctly. The product in question is the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000.

**Key Observations:**
1. The positive odd integers less than 10000 are exactly the numbers in the set `{1, 3, 5, ..., 9999}`.
2. The number of terms in this set is `5000` because the sequence is arithmetic with first term `1`, last term `9999`, and common difference `2`. The number of terms is `(9999 - 1)/2 + 1 = 9998 / 2 + 1 = 4999 + 1 = 5000`.
3. The product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is `1 * 3 * 5 * ... * 9999 = 9999! / 2^{4999} * 4999!` (this is a known combinatorial identity for the product of odd numbers).

But wait, the Lean statement is:
`Finset.prod (Finset.filter (fun x => ¬Even x) (Finset.range 10000)) (id : ℕ → ℕ) = 10000! / (2 ^ 5000 * 5000!)`

This is correct because:
- The product of all odd numbers `x` in `0..10000` is `1 * 3 * 5 * ... * 9999 = 9999! / 2^{4999} * 4999!` (as above).
- But `4999! = 5000! / 5000`, so `9999! / 2^{4999} * 4999! = 9999! / (2^{4999} * 5000!) * 5000! = 10000! / (2^{5000} * 5000!)` (since `10000! = 9999! * 10000` and `10000 = 2^4 * 5^4`).

But wait, the Lean statement is `10000! / (2 ^ 5000 * 5000!)`, not `10000! / (2 ^ 4999 * 4999!)`.

But `5000! = 4999! * 5000`, so `2 ^ 5000 * 5000! = 2 ^ 5000 * 4999! * 5000 = 2 ^ 4999 * 4999! * 2 * 5000 = 2 ^ 4999 * 4999! * 10000`.

But `10000! = 9999! * 10000`, so `10000! / (2 ^ 5000 * 5000!) = (9999! * 10000) / (2 ^ 5000 * 4999! * 5000) = (9999! * 10000) / (2 ^ 4999 * 4999! * 10000) = 9999! / (2 ^ 4999 * 4999!) = 1 * 3 * 5 * ... * 9999 / (2 ^ 4999 * 1 * 3 * 5 * ... * 4999) = 5000 / 2 ^ 4999 = 5000 / 2 ^ 4999`.

But this is not matching the Lean statement.

**Re-evaluating the Lean statement:**
The Lean statement is `10000! / (2 ^ 5000 * 5000!)`, which is correct because:
`10000! = 10000 * 9999! = 2^4 * 5^4 * 9999!` and `2 ^ 5000 * 5000! = 2 ^ 5000 * 4999! * 5000 = 2 ^ 5000 * 4999! * 2^4 * 5^4 = 2 ^ 5004 * 4999! * 5^4`.

But `10000! / (2 ^ 5000 * 5000!) = (2^4 * 5^4 * 9999!) / (2 ^ 5004 * 4999! * 5^4) = (2^4 * 5^4 * 9999!) / (2 ^ 5004 * 4999! * 5^4) = (2^4 * 5^4 * 9999!) / (2 ^ 5004 * 4999! * 5^4) = (2^4 * 5^4 * 9999!) / (2 ^ 5004 * 4999! * 5^4) = ...`

This seems too complicated.

**Alternative Approach:**
The product of all positive odd integers less than `2n` is `(2n - 1)!! = (2n)! / (2^n * n!)` (this is a known identity).

For `n = 5000`, the product is `9999!! = 10000! / (2^5000 * 5000!)`, which is exactly the Lean statement.

Thus, the Lean statement is correct.

### Step 1: Understand the Product of Odd Integers

The product of all positive odd integers less than `10000` is `(2 * 5000 - 1)!! = 9999!!`.

This is a double factorial, which can be expressed as:
`9999!! = 10000! / (2^5000 * 5000!)` (this is a known combinatorial identity).

### Step 2: Verify the Lean Statement

The Lean statement is:
`Finset.prod (Finset.filter (fun x => ¬Even x) (Finset.range 10000)) (id : ℕ → ℕ) = 10000! / (2 ^ 5000 * 5000!)`

This is correct because:
1. The product of all odd numbers in `0..10000` is `9999!! = 10000! / (2^5000 * 5000!)`.
2. The Lean statement matches this identity.

### Step 3: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Product**:
   - The product of all positive odd integers less than `10000` is `9999!!`.
   - `9999!! = 10000! / (2^5000 * 5000!)` is a known combinatorial identity.

2. **Verify the Lean Statement**:
   - The Lean statement correctly represents `9999!!` as `10000! / (2^5000 * 5000!)`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The Lean statement is correct because it matches the combinatorial identity for the product of odd integers.
