### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to prove that for any real number \( x > -1 \) and any natural number \( n > 0 \), the inequality \( 1 + n x \leq (1 + x)^n \) holds.

#### Key Observations:
1. The inequality resembles the Bernoulli inequality, but it is not directly applicable here because the exponent \( n \) is a natural number and the coefficient \( n \) is not necessarily positive. However, we can use induction on \( n \).
2. The base case \( n = 1 \) is straightforward:
   \[ 1 + 1 \cdot x = 1 + x \leq (1 + x)^1 = 1 + x. \]
   The inequality becomes an equality, so it holds.
3. For the inductive step, assume the inequality holds for some \( n \geq 1 \), i.e.,
   \[ 1 + n x \leq (1 + x)^n. \]
   We need to prove it for \( n + 1 \), i.e.,
   \[ 1 + (n + 1) x \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1}. \]
   Simplifying the right-hand side:
   \[ (1 + x)^{n + 1} = (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x). \]
   Thus, the inequality becomes:
   \[ 1 + (n + 1) x \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x). \]
   By the inductive hypothesis, we can substitute \( (1 + x)^n \geq 1 + n x \), but this is not directly helpful. Instead, we can use the fact that \( x > -1 \) to ensure that \( 1 + x > 0 \), and we can multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 1 + x \) without changing the direction of the inequality.
   However, this seems complicated, and it might be better to directly prove the inductive step by using the binomial expansion.

#### Alternative Approach: Binomial Expansion
The binomial expansion of \( (1 + x)^n \) is:
\[ (1 + x)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k. \]
Thus, the inequality becomes:
\[ 1 + n x \leq \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k. \]
We can rearrange this as:
\[ 1 + n x - 1 \leq \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k - 1, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ n x \leq \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k - 1. \]
This is not obviously true, so the binomial approach does not seem straightforward.

#### Better Approach: Induction
Instead, we can use induction directly.

**Base Case (\( n = 1 \))**:
\[ 1 + 1 \cdot x = 1 + x \leq (1 + x)^1 = 1 + x. \]
The inequality becomes an equality, so it holds.

**Inductive Step**:
Assume the inequality holds for some \( n \geq 1 \), i.e.,
\[ 1 + n x \leq (1 + x)^n. \]
We need to prove it for \( n + 1 \), i.e.,
\[ 1 + (n + 1) x \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1}. \]

Multiply both sides of the inductive hypothesis by \( 1 + x \):
\[ (1 + x)(1 + n x) \leq (1 + x)(1 + x)^n. \]
Simplify the left-hand side:
\[ 1 + n x + x + n x^2 = 1 + (n + 1) x + n x^2. \]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[ (1 + x)(1 + x)^n = (1 + x)^{n + 1}. \]
Thus, we have:
\[ 1 + (n + 1) x + n x^2 \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1}. \]
But we need to prove:
\[ 1 + (n + 1) x \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1}. \]
This is not necessarily true unless \( n x^2 \geq 0 \), which is true because \( x^2 \geq 0 \). However, we have \( n \geq 1 \), so \( n x^2 \geq 0 \) is true. Thus, the inequality holds for \( n + 1 \).

By induction, the inequality holds for all \( n \geq 1 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Base Case (\( n = 1 \))**:
   - Verify that \( 1 + 1 \cdot x \leq (1 + x)^1 \) simplifies to \( 1 + x \leq 1 + x \), which is true.

2. **Inductive Step**:
   - Assume the inequality holds for some \( n \geq 1 \), i.e., \( 1 + n x \leq (1 + x)^n \).
   - Multiply both sides by \( 1 + x \) to get \( (1 + x)(1 + n x) \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1} \).
   - Expand the left-hand side to \( 1 + (n + 1) x + n x^2 \).
   - Since \( n x^2 \geq 0 \), we have \( 1 + (n + 1) x + n x^2 \leq 1 + (n + 1) x \), which is the desired inequality.
