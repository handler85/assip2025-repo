### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
- We have a set `S` of integers `x` such that `|x| < 3 * π`.
- We need to find the cardinality of `S`, which is claimed to be `19`.

#### Step 1: Understand the Condition `|x| < 3 * π`

1. **Find the range of `x` such that `|x| < 3 * π`**:
   - `3 * π ≈ 3 * 3.1415 ≈ 9.4245`.
   - The condition `|x| < 3 * π` is equivalent to `-3 * π < x < 3 * π`.
   - Numerically, this is `-9.4245 < x < 9.4245`.

2. **Find the integer bounds**:
   - The largest integer `x` such that `x < 3 * π` is `9` because `3 * π ≈ 9.4245` and `9 < 3 * π < 10`.
   - The smallest integer `x` such that `x > -3 * π` is `-9` because `-3 * π ≈ -9.4245` and `-10 < -3 * π < -9`.

3. **Check the bounds**:
   - `3 * π ≈ 9.4245` and `-3 * π ≈ -9.4245`.
   - The integers `x` satisfying `-3 * π < x < 3 * π` are `-9, -8, ..., 9` (total of `19` integers).

#### Step 2: Formalize the Bounds

1. **Upper Bound**:
   - We need to find the largest integer `x` such that `x < 3 * π`.
   - `3 * π ≈ 9.4245`, so `x = 9` is the largest integer `< 3 * π`.

2. **Lower Bound**:
   - We need to find the smallest integer `x` such that `x > -3 * π`.
   - `-3 * π ≈ -9.4245`, so `x = -9` is the smallest integer `> -3 * π`.

3. **Count the Integers**:
   - The integers from `-9` to `9` inclusive are `-9, -8, ..., 9` (total of `19` integers).

#### Step 3: Prove the Cardinality

1. **Characterize `S`**:
   - `S = {x ∈ ℤ | |x| < 3 * π}`.
   - We need to find all integers `x` such that `-3 * π < x < 3 * π`.

2. **Find the Bounds**:
   - `3 * π ≈ 9.4245`, so `x < 3 * π` is `x ≤ 9` (since `x` is integer).
   - `-3 * π ≈ -9.4245`, so `x > -3 * π` is `x ≥ -9` (since `x` is integer).

3. **List the Integers**:
   - `x ∈ {-9, -8, ..., 9}`.
   - Total count: `9 - (-9) + 1 = 19`.

4. **Formal Proof**:
   - We need to show that `S` is exactly the set of integers `x` such that `-9 ≤ x ≤ 9`.
   - This is because `3 * π ≈ 9.4245` and `-3 * π ≈ -9.4245`, so the integer bounds are `-9` and `9`.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Condition**:
   - The set `S` consists of all integers `x` such that `|x| < 3 * π`.

2. **Find the Bounds**:
   - Find the largest integer `x` such that `x < 3 * π`.
   - Find the smallest integer `x` such that `x > -3 * π`.

3. **Calculate the Bounds Numerically**:
   - `3 * π ≈ 9.4245`, so the largest integer `< 3 * π` is `9`.
   - `-3 * π ≈ -9.4245`, so the smallest integer `> -3 * π` is `-9`.

4. **List the Integers**:
   - The integers `x` satisfying `-9 ≤ x ≤ 9` are `-9, -8, ..., 9` (total of `19` integers).

5. **Prove the Cardinality**:
   - The set `S` is exactly the set of integers `x` such that `-9 ≤ x ≤ 9`, so its cardinality is `19`.
