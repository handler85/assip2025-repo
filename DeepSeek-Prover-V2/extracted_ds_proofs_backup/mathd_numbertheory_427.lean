### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:
1. **Given**: `a = ∑ k in Nat.divisors 500, k`
2. **Find**: `∑ k in Finset.filter (fun x => Nat.Prime x) (Nat.divisors a), k`

#### Step 1: Find the Sum of Divisors of 500
First, factorize 500:
`500 = 2² × 5³`

The sum of the divisors of `n = p₁^a₁ * p₂^a₂ * ... * p_k^a_k` is:
`σ(n) = (1 + p₁ + p₁² + ... + p₁^a₁) * (1 + p₂ + p₂² + ... + p₂^a₂) * ... * (1 + p_k + p_k² + ... + p_k^a_k)`

For `500 = 2² × 5³`:
`σ(500) = (1 + 2 + 4) * (1 + 5 + 25 + 125) = 7 * 156 = 1092`

But wait, let's verify this calculation:
`1 + 2 + 4 = 7`
`1 + 5 + 25 + 125 = 156`
`7 * 156 = 1092`

This matches the expected result.

#### Step 2: Find the Sum of Distinct Prime Divisors of `a = 1092`
First, factorize `1092`:
`1092 = 2² × 3 × 7 × 13`

The distinct prime divisors are `2, 3, 7, 13`.

The sum of these distinct primes is:
`2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25`

#### Step 3: Verify the Lean 4 Statement
The Lean 4 statement is:
```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_427 (a : ℕ) (h₀ : a = ∑ k in Nat.divisors 500, k) :
    (∑ k in Finset.filter (fun x => Nat.Prime x) (Nat.divisors a), k) = 25 := by
  sorry
```

Given that `a = 1092` and the sum of the distinct prime divisors of `1092` is `25`, the Lean 4 statement is correct.

### Step 4: Abstract Plan

1. **Calculate the sum of the divisors of 500**:
   - Factorize 500 as `2² × 5³`.
   - Use the divisor sum formula to find `σ(500) = 1092`.

2. **Factorize 1092**:
   - `1092 = 2² × 3 × 7 × 13`.

3. **List the distinct prime divisors of 1092**:
   - `2, 3, 7, 13`.

4. **Sum the distinct prime divisors**:
   - `2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25`.

### Step 5: Lean 4 `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_427 (a : ℕ) (h₀ : a = ∑ k in Nat.divisors 500, k) :
    (∑ k in Finset.filter (fun x => Nat.Prime x) (Nat.divisors a), k) = 25 := by
  have h₁ : a = 1092 := by sorry
  have h₂ : (∑ k in Finset.filter (fun x => Nat.Prime x) (Nat.divisors a), k) = 25 := by sorry
  sorry
```
