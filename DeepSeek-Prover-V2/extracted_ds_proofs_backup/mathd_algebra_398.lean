### Detailed Proof

**Problem Analysis:**
We are given three positive real numbers \(a, b, c\) with the following relationships:
1. \(9b = 20c\) (Equation 1)
2. \(7a = 4b\) (Equation 2)

We need to prove that \(63a = 80c\).

**Approach:**
1. From Equation 1, express \(b\) in terms of \(c\):
   \[ b = \frac{20}{9}c \]
2. Substitute this expression for \(b\) into Equation 2 to find \(a\) in terms of \(c\):
   \[ 7a = 4 \cdot \frac{20}{9}c = \frac{80}{9}c \]
   \[ a = \frac{80}{63}c \]
3. Now, multiply both sides of \(a = \frac{80}{63}c\) by \(63\) to get:
   \[ 63a = 80c \]
   which is the desired result.

Alternatively, we can avoid solving for \(a\) in terms of \(c\) by directly manipulating the given equations. Here's an alternative approach:
1. From \(7a = 4b\), we get \(b = \frac{7}{4}a\).
2. Substitute \(b = \frac{7}{4}a\) into \(9b = 20c\) to get:
   \[ 9 \cdot \frac{7}{4}a = 20c \]
   \[ \frac{63}{4}a = 20c \]
   \[ 63a = 80c \]
   which is the desired result.

This second approach is more straightforward and avoids unnecessary fractions.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Derive \(b\) in terms of \(a\) from \(7a = 4b\)**:
   - Solve for \(b\): \(b = \frac{7}{4}a\).

2. **Substitute \(b\) into \(9b = 20c\)**:
   - Substitute \(b = \frac{7}{4}a\) into \(9b = 20c\) to get \(9 \cdot \frac{7}{4}a = 20c\).

3. **Simplify the equation to find \(63a = 80c\)**:
   - Simplify \(9 \cdot \frac{7}{4}a = \frac{63}{4}a\) to get \(\frac{63}{4}a = 20c\).
   - Multiply both sides by 4 to get \(63a = 80c\).

### Step 2: Lean 4 `have` Statements
