### Detailed Proof

**Problem:** Given the function \( f(x) = 5x + 4 \), prove that \( f(1) = 9 \).

**Solution:**
1. Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
   \[
   f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4.
   \]
2. Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9.
   \]
3. Therefore, \( f(1) = 9 \).

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) \):**
   - Replace \( x \) with \( 1 \) in the expression \( 5x + 4 \).

2. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Multiply \( 5 \) by \( 1 \) to get \( 5 \).
   - Add \( 4 \) to \( 5 \) to get \( 9 \).

3. **Conclude the result:**
   - The simplified form is \( 9 \), so \( f(1) = 9 \).
