### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, recall that `σ : Equiv ℝ ℝ` is an equivalence (i.e., a bijection) from `ℝ` to `ℝ`. The condition `σ.1 2 = σ.2 2` is equivalent to `σ.1 2 = σ.symm 2` because `σ.2 = σ.symm` by definition. 

The goal is to prove that `σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2`. 

#### Key Observations:
1. Since `σ` is a bijection, `σ.1` is injective and surjective.
2. The condition `σ.1 2 = σ.2 2` is equivalent to `σ.1 2 = σ.symm 2` because `σ.2 = σ.symm` by definition.
3. We can use the injectivity of `σ.1` to simplify the goal.

#### Proof Sketch:
1. We know that `σ.1 2 = σ.symm 2` by the given condition.
2. We need to find `σ.1 (σ.1 2)`.
3. Substitute `σ.1 2` with `σ.symm 2` to get `σ.1 (σ.symm 2)`.
4. Since `σ` is an equivalence, `σ.1 (σ.symm 2) = (σ.1 ∘ σ.symm) 2 = id 2 = 2` because `σ.1 ∘ σ.symm = id`.

#### Detailed Proof:
1. We have `σ.1 2 = σ.symm 2` by the given condition `h : σ.1 2 = σ.2 2` and the definition of `σ.2` as `σ.symm`.
2. We need to compute `σ.1 (σ.1 2)`.
3. Substitute `σ.1 2` with `σ.symm 2` to get `σ.1 (σ.symm 2)`.
4. Since `σ` is an equivalence, `σ.1 ∘ σ.symm = id`. Therefore, `σ.1 (σ.symm 2) = (σ.1 ∘ σ.symm) 2 = id 2 = 2`.
5. Hence, `σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2`.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the Given Condition**:
   - `σ.1 2 = σ.2 2` is equivalent to `σ.1 2 = σ.symm 2` because `σ.2 = σ.symm`.

2. **Understand the Goal**:
   - Prove `σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2`.

3. **Approach**:
   - Substitute `σ.1 2` with `σ.symm 2` using the given condition.
   - Use the property that `σ.1 ∘ σ.symm = id` to simplify `σ.1 (σ.symm 2)`.

4. **Detailed Steps**:
   - `σ.1 (σ.1 2) = σ.1 (σ.symm 2)` (by the given condition).
   - `σ.1 (σ.symm 2) = (σ.1 ∘ σ.symm) 2 = id 2 = 2` (since `σ.1 ∘ σ.symm = id`).
