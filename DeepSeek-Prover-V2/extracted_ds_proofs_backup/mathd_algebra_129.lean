### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem correctly. We have:
\[ \frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1 \]
and we need to find \( a \).

#### Step 1: Simplify the Fractional Expressions

First, simplify \( 8^{-1} \) and \( 4^{-1} \):
\[ 8^{-1} = \frac{1}{8} \]
\[ 4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Thus, the left-hand side (LHS) becomes:
\[ \frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 4 = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \]

But wait, this is incorrect! The correct simplification is:
\[ \frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 4 = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \]

But earlier, I thought it was \( \frac{1}{2} \), but I was wrong. The correct simplification is:
\[ \frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \frac{1/8}{1/4} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot 4 = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \]

But the original problem is:
\[ \frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1 \]

So:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1 \]

#### Step 2: Solve for \( a^{-1} \)

Subtract \( \frac{1}{2} \) from both sides:
\[ -a^{-1} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ -a^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
\[ a^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2} \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( a \)

Take reciprocals of both sides:
\[ a = -\frac{2}{1} = -2 \]

Thus, \( a = -2 \).

### Step 4: Verification

Let's verify \( a = -2 \):
\[ a^{-1} = (-2)^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \frac{1/8}{1/4} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} - (-\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \]
This checks out.

### Step 5: Abstract Plan

1. **Simplify the Fraction**:
   - Compute \( 8^{-1} = \frac{1}{8} \) and \( 4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4} \).
   - Divide the two fractions: \( \frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \frac{1/8}{1/4} = \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Substitute and Solve for \( a^{-1} \)**:
   - The equation becomes \( \frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1 \).
   - Rearrange to get \( a^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Find \( a \)**:
   - Take reciprocals: \( a = -2 \).
