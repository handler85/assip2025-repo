### Detailed Proof and Analysis

**Problem Analysis:**
We need to prove that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. 

**Key Observations:**
1. If \( n \) is not prime, then \( n \) can be factored as \( n = ab \) where \( 1 < a, b < n \).
2. The expression \( 2^n - 1 \) can be factored as \( 2^{ab} - 1 = (2^a - 1)(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + \dots + 2^a + 1) \).
3. Since \( 1 < a < n \), \( 2^a - 1 > 1 \), and \( 2^{a(b-1)} + \dots + 1 > 1 \), the product \( (2^a - 1)(2^{a(b-1)} + \dots + 1) \) is a nontrivial factorization of \( 2^n - 1 \), contradicting the primality of \( 2^n - 1 \).

**Proof Sketch:**
1. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n = ab \) for some \( 1 < a, b < n \).
2. Factor \( 2^n - 1 \) as \( (2^a - 1)(2^{a(b-1)} + \dots + 1) \).
3. Show that both factors are greater than 1, so \( 2^n - 1 \) is not prime, a contradiction.

**Detailed Proof:**
1. Suppose \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n \) has a prime divisor \( p \leq \sqrt{n} \). Let \( p \) be the smallest prime divisor of \( n \). Then \( p \leq \sqrt{n} \).
2. Since \( p \mid n \), we have \( p \mid 2^n - 1 \). This implies \( 2^n \equiv 1 \mod p \).
3. Let \( d \) be the order of \( 2 \) modulo \( p \). Then \( d \mid n \) and \( d \mid p - 1 \), because \( 2^d \equiv 1 \mod p \).
4. Since \( p \) is the smallest prime divisor of \( n \), \( d \leq p - 1 \leq \sqrt{n} - 1 \).
5. But \( d \mid n \), so \( d \leq n \). However, \( d \leq \sqrt{n} - 1 \leq n - 1 \), which is not a contradiction.
6. Alternatively, we can use the fact that if \( n \) is not prime, then \( n = ab \) with \( 1 < a, b < n \). Then:
   \[
   2^n - 1 = (2^a - 1)(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + \dots + 2^a + 1).
   \]
   Both factors are greater than 1, so \( 2^n - 1 \) is not prime, a contradiction.

**Conclusion:**
The assumption that \( n \) is not prime leads to a contradiction, so \( n \) must be prime.

### Step 1: Abstract Plan

1. **Assume \( n \) is not prime.**
   - Then \( n \) has a prime divisor \( p \leq \sqrt{n} \).

2. **Factor \( 2^n - 1 \).**
   - Since \( p \mid n \), \( p \mid 2^n - 1 \).
   - The expression \( 2^n - 1 \) can be factored as \( (2^a - 1)(2^{a(b-1)} + \dots + 1) \), where \( n = ab \).

3. **Derive a contradiction.**
   - Both factors are greater than 1, so \( 2^n - 1 \) is not prime.
   - This contradicts the hypothesis that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime.

4. **Conclude \( n \) is prime.**
   - The contradiction implies that \( n \) must be prime.
