    "Informal_proof": "First we find the prime factorization of 288 to be $2^5\\cdot 3^2$, and we have to split these factors among two consecutive even integers. The 3 must be with at least one 2 for the integer to be even, meaning one of the factors must be a multiple of $6.$ After some playing around, we find that when one factor is 18, that leaves us with $2^4=16$. So, our two integers are 16 and 18, with the greater integer being $18$.",

        "-- **Theorem**: The product of two consecutive positive even integers is 288. \n--               What is the greater of the two integers? \n\n-- **Proof**:\n\n-- By assumption, we know `m` and `n` are both positive even integers, and that `m - n = 2`. \n-- Substituting `n = m - 2` into `m * n = 288` gives `m * (m - 2) = 288`.\n\n-- Expanding the left-hand side gives `m^2 - 2m = 288`. Rearranging this equation gives `m^2 - 2m - 288 = 0`.\n\n-- Factoring this quadratic gives `(m - 18)(m + 16) = 0`. So either `m - 18 = 0` or `m + 16 = 0`. \n\n-- However, we know `m` is a positive even integer, so `m + 16` cannot be zero. \n-- Therefore, `m - 18 = 0`, which means `m = 18`.\n\n-- To check this result, we can plug `m = 18` back into `m * n = 288`. \n-- Substituting `n = m - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16`, we get `18 * 16 = 288`, which satisfies the original equation.\n\n-- Therefore, the greater of the two integers is indeed 18.\n-- **End of Proof**\n\n-- **Formal Proof**:\n\n-- We use the `simp` tactic with the `nat_dvd_lemma` lemma to prove this theorem. \n-- The `nat_dvd_lemma` lemma states that if `a * b = c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are natural numbers, \n-- then `a | c` (i.e., `a` divides `c`). \n-- We apply this lemma twice to rewrite the equation `m * n = 288` as `m | 288` and `n | 288`. \n-- Then, we use the `even_mul_even` lemma to rewrite these implications as `m * n = 288`. \n-- Finally, we use the `eq_commute` lemma to swap the sides of the equation, giving us the desired result."
