    "Informal_proof": "Clearly if the $x_i$ are all equal, then they are equal to 0. Now let's assume WLOG that $x_1=0$. If $x_2$ or $x_3$ is 0, then the other is clearly zero, so let's consider the case where neither are 0. $a_{12}$ and $a_{21}$ are negative, so exactly one of $x_2$ or $x_3$ is positive. Unfortunately this means that one of $a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3$ or $a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0$ is positive and the other is negative, so the equation couldn't possibly be satisfied if $x_2$ or $x_3$ isn't 0. We have covered the case where one of the $x_i$ is 0, now let's assume that none of them are 0.\n\nIf two are positive and one is negative, then when the negative $x_i$ is paired with one of the positive $a_i$, the corresponding equation is negative. This is bad. If two are negative and one is positive, then when the positive $x_i$ is paired with one of the positive $a_i$, the corresponding equation is positive. This is also bad. Therefore the $x_i$ all have the same sign.\n\nCase 1: The $x_i$ are all positive. WLOG $x_1\\leq x_2\\leq x_3$. Now consider the third equation, $a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0$. Therefore $x_2(a_{31} +a_{32}+a_{33})+ a_{31}(x_1-x_2)+a_{33}(x_3-x_2)= 0$, but all of the terms on the LHS are non-negative and the first one is positive, so this is impossible.\n\nCase 2: The $x_i$ are all negative. WLOG $x_1\\geq x_2\\geq x_3$. Consider the third equation, $a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0$. Therefore $x_3(a_{31}+a_{32}+a_{33})+a_{31}(x_1-x_3)+a_{32}(x_2-x_3)=0$, but all of the terms on the LHS are non-positive and the first one is negative, so this is impossible.\n\nTherefore at least one of the $x_i$ is 0, which implies all of them are 0.",
