    "Informal_proof": "Let $a$ be the first term in this arithmetic sequence, and let $d$ be the common difference.  Then the $7^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + 6d = 30$, and the $11^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + 10d = 60$.  Subtracting these equations, we get $4d = 30$, so $d = 30/4 = 15/2$.\n\nThen the $21^{\\text{st}}$ term is $a + 20d = (a + 10d) + 10d = 60 + 10 \\cdot 15/2 = 135$.",
