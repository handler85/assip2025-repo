Specifically, provide the hypotheses `h₀`, `h₁`, `h₂`, and `h₃`\n--   along with the inequality `h₄`. This allows the `linarith` tactic to perform\n--   the necessary calculations and derive the desired result.\n--\n--   Note: Due to the limitations of Lean's built-in linear arithmetic capabilities,\n--         this proof relies on the `linarith` tactic, which may not always produce\n--         the most efficient or exact solutions.

Use the `simp_all` tactic to automatically simplify the goal.\n-- 2. Use the `ge_of_eq_of_ge_left` tactic to convert the inequality `h₄` to an\n--    equality.\n-- 3. Use the `sub_right_inj'` tactic to injectively subtract the squares of x and y.\n-- 4. Use the `rw` tactic to rewrite the resulting expression using the definitions\n--    of `h₀` and `h₁`.\n-- 5.
