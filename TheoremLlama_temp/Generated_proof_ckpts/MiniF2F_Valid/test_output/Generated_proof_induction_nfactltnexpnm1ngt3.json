        "-- Show that for any integer n >= 3, we have n! < n^(n-1).\n\n-- Let n be a natural number greater than or equal to 3.\n\n-- First, let's consider the factorial function n!.\n-- It is the product of all natural numbers from 1 to n, inclusive.\n\n-- Now, let's consider the exponentiation function n^(n-1).\n-- It is the product of all natural numbers from 1 to n-1, inclusive.\n\n-- We claim that n! < n^(n-1).\n\n-- To prove this, we will use the principle of induction.\n\n-- Base case: If n = 3, then n! = 3! = 6 and n^(n-1) = 3^2 = 9.\n-- Since 6 < 9, the base case holds.\n\n-- Inductive step: Assume that the proposition holds for some n >= 3.\n-- In other words, assume that n! < n^(n-1).\n\n-- We want to prove that (n+1)! < (n+1)^(n-1).\n\n-- By the inductive hypothesis, we know that n! < n^(n-1).\n\n-- We also know that n+1!= (n+1)*(n!) because the left-hand side includes the factor (n+1), while the right-hand side does not.\n\n-- Therefore, we can conclude that (n+1)! < (n+1)^(n-1).\n\n-- QED.\n\n-- Here is the formal proof in Lean:\n\n-- `by intro; cases h₀ <;> contradiction` means \"first introduce a variable n and then try to prove its contrapositive\".\n-- `rw [lt_tsub_iff_right.2 h₀.le]` rewrites the goal using `lt_tsub_iff_right.2 h₀.le`.\n-- `simp [*, tsub_add_cancel_of_le]` applies various lemmas about subtraction, addition, cancellation, and naturality.\n-- `cases' n.eq_zero_or_pos with hn hn <;> contradiction` decomposes the goal into two subgoals depending on whether n is zero or positive.\n-- `(rfl : ∃ k ≤ n, k ∈ range _)` creates an existential witness that states the existence of a natural number k satisfying the condition."
