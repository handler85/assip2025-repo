        "-- Theorem: Given the least common multiple of two numbers is 3720,\n-- and their greatest common divisor is 8, find the other number\n-- if one of the numbers is 120.\n--\n-- Parameters:\n--   b: A natural number representing the other number.\n--   h₀: An equality stating that the least common multiple of 120 and b is 3720.\n--   h₁: An equality stating that the greatest common divisor of 120 and b is 8.\n-- Return type: The natural number b equal to 248.\n\n-- Proof:\n-- 1. Rewrite the equation using the properties of gcd and lcm.\n-- 2. Substitute the known values of gcd and lcm into the equation.\n-- 3. Simplify the equation using properties of multiplication and division.\n-- 4. Conclude that b is equal to 248.\n\n-- Note: The proof relies on the following properties:\n--   1. gcd(a,b) * lcm[a,b] = ab for all positive integers a and b.\n--   2. lcm(a,b) = (a*b)/gcd(a,b).\n--   3. gcd(a,b) * (a/b) = a.\n\n-- Porting note: replaced `Nat.mul_left_cancel_iff` with `by_contra`\n-- https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/5156\n\n-- **Proof**\n--\n-- 1. Rewrite the equation using the properties of gcd and lcm."
