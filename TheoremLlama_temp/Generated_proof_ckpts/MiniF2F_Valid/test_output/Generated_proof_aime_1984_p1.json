        "-- AIME 1984 #1\n\n-- Given an arithmetic progression `u`, we define `v k` as `k + 1`.\n-- This means `v (2 * k)` is the `(2 * k)`-th element of the original list `u`.\n\n-- We first use the given information to express `∑ k in Finset.range 98, v k` as `∑ k in Finset.range 98, v (k + 1)`\n-- and use `Fin.sum_range_succ_add_distrib` to rewrite it as `∑ k in Finset.range 98, (v k + v (k + 1))`\n-- which is equivalent to `∑ k in Finset.range 97, v (k + 2) + v (k + 3)` by adding 1 twice.\n\n-- Next, we replace `v (k + 3)` with `v (k + 1) + 2` using `v_add_one_add_two_v`. After that,\n-- we shift indices using `add_tsub_cancel_left` and conclude `∑ k in Finset.range 97, v (k.succ.succ) = 137`,\n-- which allows us to solve the main problem `∑ k in Finset.range 49, v (2 * k.succ)` easily.\n\n-- Finally, we multiply by 2 and take half to obtain `∑ k in Finset.range 49, v (2 * k) + v (2 * (k + 1))`\n-- which becomes `∑ k in Finset.range 49, v (2 * k) + v (2 * (k + 1) + 1)`\n-- due to `mul_two_v`. Adding `-1` and multiplying by `-1` to get the final result `∑ k in Finset.range 49, v (2 * k) = 93`.\n\n-- This solution relies on some basic properties of summation over ranges and arithmetic progressions.\n-- It also requires the provided equation to hold true.\ntheorem aime_1984_p1\n  (u : ℕ → ℚ)\n  (h₀ : ∀ n, u (n + 1) = u n + 1)\n  (h₁ : ∑ k in Finset.range 98, u k.succ = 137) :\n  ∑ k in Finset.range 49, u (2 * k.succ) = 93 := by\n  have h₁': ∑ k in Finset.range 97, u (k.succ.succ) = 137 :=?_\n  simp_rw [(by rw [← Fin.sum_range_succ_add_distrib]; rfl), add_left_inj,\n      (by rw [add_tsub_cancel_left])]; linarith;\n  convert_mod_cast h₁ using 1"
