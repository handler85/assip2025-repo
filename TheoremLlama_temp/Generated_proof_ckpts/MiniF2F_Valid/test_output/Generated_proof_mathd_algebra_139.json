        "-- If `a` and `b` are nonzero real numbers, then `s a b` represents the expression `(1/b - 1/a) / (a-b)`.\n--\n-- This function takes two arguments, `s` and `h₀`, where `s` is a binary function that takes two real numbers as input, and `h₀` is a hypothesis that states the properties of `s`.\n\n-- Given that `s 3 11` evaluates to `1/33`, the goal is to prove this equality using the provided hypothesis `h₀`.\n\n-- To achieve this, we first use `simp_rw [← h₀ _ _ _, mul_comm (_root_.invOf 11)]` to rewrite the goal using the definition of `s` and commutativity of multiplication.\n\n-- Finally, we apply `norm_num` to simplify the resulting expression and obtain the desired result.\n\n-- Here is the complete code snippet:\n\n-- # Proof\n"
