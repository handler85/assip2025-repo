    "Informal_statement": "The four-digit number $\\underline{374n}$ is divisible by 18. Find the units digit $n$. Show that it is 4.",
    "Informal_proof": "We know that the prime factorization of 18 is $2\\cdot 3^2$, so in order for the four digit number to be divisible by 18 it must also be divisible by 9 and 2. In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 as well. Thus, $3+7+4+n$, or $14+n$, must be divisible by 9. Since 18 is the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 10, $14+n=18$, and $n=18-14=4$.",
