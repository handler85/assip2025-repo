    "Informal_proof": "We have that $0 \\leq (a-b+1)^2 = a^2+b^2+1-2ab+2a-2b$. Since $a^2+b^2=1$, the inequality becomes $0 \\leq 2-2ab+2a-2b$, so $0 \\leq 1-ab+a-b$.\nSimilarly, by expanding $0 \\leq (b-a+1)^2$ we have that $0 \\leq 1-ba+b-a$.\nCombining these two inequalities, we have that $ab+\\lvert a-b\\rvert \\leq 1$.",
